      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, Prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter: the latter, a\n",
      "most beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called Matilda. Conrad, the\n",
      "son, was three years younger, a homely youth, sickly, and of no promising\n",
      "disposition; yet he was the darling of his father, who never showed any\n",
      "symptoms of affection to Matilda. Manfred had contracted a marriage for\n",
      "his son with the Marquis of Vicenza’s daughter, Isabella; and she had\n",
      "already been delivered by her guardians into the hands of Manfred, that\n",
      "he might celebrate the wedding as soon as Conrad’s infirm state of health\n",
      "would permit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred’s impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family and\n",
      "neighbours. The former, indeed, apprehending the severity of their\n",
      "Prince’s disposition, did not dare to utter their surmises on this\n",
      "precipitation. Hippolita, his wife, an amiable lady, did sometimes\n",
      "venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son so early,\n",
      "considering his great youth, and greater infirmities; but she never\n",
      "received any other answer than reflections on her own sterility, who had\n",
      "given him but one heir. His tenants and subjects were less cautious in\n",
      "their discourses. They attributed this hasty wedding to the Prince’s\n",
      "dread of seeing accomplished an ancient prophecy, which was said to have\n",
      "pronounced that the castle and lordship of Otranto “should pass from the\n",
      "present family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to\n",
      "inhabit it.” It was difficult to make any sense of this prophecy; and\n",
      "still less easy to conceive what it had to do with the marriage in\n",
      "question. Yet these mysteries, or contradictions, did not make the\n",
      "populace adhere the less to their opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Young Conrad’s birthday was fixed for his espousals. The company was\n",
      "assembled in the chapel of the Castle, and everything ready for beginning\n",
      "the divine office, when Conrad himself was missing. Manfred, impatient\n",
      "of the least delay, and who had not observed his son retire, despatched\n",
      "one of his attendants to summon the young Prince. The servant, who had\n",
      "not stayed long enough to have crossed the court to Conrad’s apartment,\n",
      "came running back breathless, in a frantic manner, his eyes staring, and\n",
      "foaming at the mouth. He said nothing, but pointed to the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company were struck with terror and amazement. The Princess\n",
      "Hippolita, without knowing what was the matter, but anxious for her son,\n",
      "swooned away. Manfred, less apprehensive than enraged at the\n",
      "procrastination of the nuptials, and at the folly of his domestic, asked\n",
      "imperiously what was the matter? The fellow made no answer, but\n",
      "continued pointing towards the courtyard; and at last, after repeated\n",
      "questions put to him, cried out, “Oh! the helmet! the helmet!”\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, some of the company had run into the court, from whence\n",
      "was heard a confused noise of shrieks, horror, and surprise. Manfred,\n",
      "who began to be alarmed at not seeing his son, went himself to get\n",
      "information of what occasioned this strange confusion. Matilda remained\n",
      "endeavouring to assist her mother, and Isabella stayed for the same\n",
      "purpose, and to avoid showing any impatience for the bridegroom, for\n",
      "whom, in truth, she had conceived little affection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing that struck Manfred’s eyes was a group of his servants\n",
      "endeavouring to raise something that appeared to him a mountain of sable\n",
      "plumes. He gazed without believing his sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What are ye doing?” cried Manfred, wrathfully; “where is my son?”\n",
      "\n",
      "A volley of voices replied, “Oh! my Lord! the Prince! the Prince! the\n",
      "helmet! the helmet!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Shocked with these lamentable sounds, and dreading he knew not what, he\n",
      "advanced hastily,—but what a sight for a father’s eyes!—he beheld his\n",
      "child dashed to pieces, and almost buried under an enormous helmet, an\n",
      "hundred times more large than any casque ever made for human being, and\n",
      "shaded with a proportionable quantity of black feathers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horror of the spectacle, the ignorance of all around how this\n",
      "misfortune had happened, and above all, the tremendous phenomenon before\n",
      "him, took away the Prince’s speech. Yet his silence lasted longer than\n",
      "even grief could occasion. He fixed his eyes on what he wished in vain\n",
      "to believe a vision; and seemed less attentive to his loss, than buried\n",
      "in meditation on the stupendous object that had occasioned it. He\n",
      "touched, he examined the fatal casque; nor could even the bleeding\n",
      "mangled remains of the young Prince divert the eyes of Manfred from the\n",
      "portent before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "All who had known his partial fondness for young Conrad, were as much\n",
      "surprised at their Prince’s insensibility, as thunderstruck themselves at\n",
      "the miracle of the helmet. They conveyed the disfigured corpse into the\n",
      "hall, without receiving the least direction from Manfred. As little was\n",
      "he attentive to the ladies who remained in the chapel. On the contrary,\n",
      "without mentioning the unhappy princesses, his wife and daughter, the\n",
      "first sounds that dropped from Manfred’s lips were, “Take care of the\n",
      "Lady Isabella.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The domestics, without observing the singularity of this direction, were\n",
      "guided by their affection to their mistress, to consider it as peculiarly\n",
      "addressed to her situation, and flew to her assistance. They conveyed\n",
      "her to her chamber more dead than alive, and indifferent to all the\n",
      "strange circumstances she heard, except the death of her son.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matilda, who doted on her mother, smothered her own grief and amazement,\n",
      "and thought of nothing but assisting and comforting her afflicted parent.\n",
      "Isabella, who had been treated by Hippolita like a daughter, and who\n",
      "returned that tenderness with equal duty and affection, was scarce less\n",
      "assiduous about the Princess; at the same time endeavouring to partake\n",
      "and lessen the weight of sorrow which she saw Matilda strove to suppress,\n",
      "for whom she had conceived the warmest sympathy of friendship. Yet her\n",
      "own situation could not help finding its place in her thoughts. She felt\n",
      "no concern for the death of young Conrad, except commiseration; and she\n",
      "was not sorry to be delivered from a marriage which had promised her\n",
      "little felicity, either from her destined bridegroom, or from the severe\n",
      "temper of Manfred, who, though he had distinguished her by great\n",
      "indulgence, had imprinted her mind with terror, from his causeless rigour\n",
      "to such amiable princesses as Hippolita and Matilda.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the ladies were conveying the wretched mother to her bed, Manfred\n",
      "remained in the court, gazing on the ominous casque, and regardless of\n",
      "the crowd which the strangeness of the event had now assembled around\n",
      "him. The few words he articulated, tended solely to inquiries, whether\n",
      "any man knew from whence it could have come? Nobody could give him the\n",
      "least information. However, as it seemed to be the sole object of his\n",
      "curiosity, it soon became so to the rest of the spectators, whose\n",
      "conjectures were as absurd and improbable, as the catastrophe itself was\n",
      "unprecedented. In the midst of their senseless guesses, a young peasant,\n",
      "whom rumour had drawn thither from a neighbouring village, observed that\n",
      "the miraculous helmet was exactly like that on the figure in black marble\n",
      "of Alfonso the Good, one of their former princes, in the church of St.\n",
      "Nicholas.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Villain! What sayest thou?” cried Manfred, starting from his trance in\n",
      "a tempest of rage, and seizing the young man by the collar; “how darest\n",
      "thou utter such treason? Thy life shall pay for it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The spectators, who as little comprehended the cause of the Prince’s fury\n",
      "as all the rest they had seen, were at a loss to unravel this new\n",
      "circumstance. The young peasant himself was still more astonished, not\n",
      "conceiving how he had offended the Prince. Yet recollecting himself,\n",
      "with a mixture of grace and humility, he disengaged himself from\n",
      "Manfred’s grip, and then with an obeisance, which discovered more\n",
      "jealousy of innocence than dismay, he asked, with respect, of what he was\n",
      "guilty? Manfred, more enraged at the vigour, however decently exerted,\n",
      "with which the young man had shaken off his hold, than appeased by his\n",
      "submission, ordered his attendants to seize him, and, if he had not been\n",
      "withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the nuptials, would have\n",
      "poignarded the peasant in their arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this altercation, some of the vulgar spectators had run to the\n",
      "great church, which stood near the castle, and came back open-mouthed,\n",
      "declaring that the helmet was missing from Alfonso’s statue. Manfred, at\n",
      "this news, grew perfectly frantic; and, as if he sought a subject on\n",
      "which to vent the tempest within him, he rushed again on the young\n",
      "peasant, crying—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Villain! Monster! Sorcerer! ’tis thou hast done this! ’tis thou hast\n",
      "slain my son!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mob, who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities, on\n",
      "whom they might discharge their bewildered reasoning, caught the words\n",
      "from the mouth of their lord, and re-echoed—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, ay; ’tis he, ’tis he: he has stolen the helmet from good Alfonso’s\n",
      "tomb, and dashed out the brains of our young Prince with it,” never\n",
      "reflecting how enormous the disproportion was between the marble helmet\n",
      "that had been in the church, and that of steel before their eyes; nor how\n",
      "impossible it was for a youth seemingly not twenty, to wield a piece of\n",
      "armour of so prodigious a weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The folly of these ejaculations brought Manfred to himself: yet whether\n",
      "provoked at the peasant having observed the resemblance between the two\n",
      "helmets, and thereby led to the farther discovery of the absence of that\n",
      "in the church, or wishing to bury any such rumour under so impertinent a\n",
      "supposition, he gravely pronounced that the young man was certainly a\n",
      "necromancer, and that till the Church could take cognisance of the\n",
      "affair, he would have the Magician, whom they had thus detected, kept\n",
      "prisoner under the helmet itself, which he ordered his attendants to\n",
      "raise, and place the young man under it; declaring he should be kept\n",
      "there without food, with which his own infernal art might furnish him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous\n",
      "sentence: in vain did Manfred’s friends endeavour to divert him from this\n",
      "savage and ill-grounded resolution. The generality were charmed with\n",
      "their lord’s decision, which, to their apprehensions, carried great\n",
      "appearance of justice, as the Magician was to be punished by the very\n",
      "instrument with which he had offended: nor were they struck with the\n",
      "least compunction at the probability of the youth being starved, for they\n",
      "firmly believed that, by his diabolic skill, he could easily supply\n",
      "himself with nutriment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred thus saw his commands even cheerfully obeyed; and appointing a\n",
      "guard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the\n",
      "prisoner, he dismissed his friends and attendants, and retired to his own\n",
      "chamber, after locking the gates of the castle, in which he suffered none\n",
      "but his domestics to remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, the care and zeal of the young Ladies had brought the\n",
      "Princess Hippolita to herself, who amidst the transports of her own\n",
      "sorrow frequently demanded news of her lord, would have dismissed her\n",
      "attendants to watch over him, and at last enjoined Matilda to leave her,\n",
      "and visit and comfort her father. Matilda, who wanted no affectionate\n",
      "duty to Manfred, though she trembled at his austerity, obeyed the orders\n",
      "of Hippolita, whom she tenderly recommended to Isabella; and inquiring of\n",
      "the domestics for her father, was informed that he was retired to his\n",
      "chamber, and had commanded that nobody should have admittance to him.\n",
      "Concluding that he was immersed in sorrow for the death of her brother,\n",
      "and fearing to renew his tears by the sight of his sole remaining child,\n",
      "she hesitated whether she should break in upon his affliction; yet\n",
      "solicitude for him, backed by the commands of her mother, encouraged her\n",
      "to venture disobeying the orders he had given; a fault she had never been\n",
      "guilty of before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentle timidity of her nature made her pause for some minutes at his\n",
      "door. She heard him traverse his chamber backwards, and forwards with\n",
      "disordered steps; a mood which increased her apprehensions. She was,\n",
      "however, just going to beg admittance, when Manfred suddenly opened the\n",
      "door; and as it was now twilight, concurring with the disorder of his\n",
      "mind, he did not distinguish the person, but asked angrily, who it was?\n",
      "Matilda replied, trembling—\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dearest father, it is I, your daughter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, stepping back hastily, cried, “Begone! I do not want a\n",
      "daughter;” and flinging back abruptly, clapped the door against the\n",
      "terrified Matilda.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was too well acquainted with her father’s impetuosity to venture a\n",
      "second intrusion. When she had a little recovered the shock of so bitter\n",
      "a reception, she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional stab that\n",
      "the knowledge of it would give to Hippolita, who questioned her in the\n",
      "most anxious terms on the health of Manfred, and how he bore his loss.\n",
      "Matilda assured her he was well, and supported his misfortune with manly\n",
      "fortitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But will he not let me see him?” said Hippolita mournfully; “will he not\n",
      "permit me to blend my tears with his, and shed a mother’s sorrows in the\n",
      "bosom of her Lord? Or do you deceive me, Matilda? I know how Manfred\n",
      "doted on his son: is not the stroke too heavy for him? has he not sunk\n",
      "under it? You do not answer me—alas! I dread the worst!—Raise me, my\n",
      "maidens; I will, I will see my Lord. Bear me to him instantly: he is\n",
      "dearer to me even than my children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Matilda made signs to Isabella to prevent Hippolita’s rising; and both\n",
      "those lovely young women were using their gentle violence to stop and\n",
      "calm the Princess, when a servant, on the part of Manfred, arrived and\n",
      "told Isabella that his Lord demanded to speak with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With me!” cried Isabella.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go,” said Hippolita, relieved by a message from her Lord: “Manfred\n",
      "cannot support the sight of his own family. He thinks you less\n",
      "disordered than we are, and dreads the shock of my grief. Console him,\n",
      "dear Isabella, and tell him I will smother my own anguish rather than add\n",
      "to his.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As it was now evening the servant who conducted Isabella bore a torch\n",
      "before her. When they came to Manfred, who was walking impatiently about\n",
      "the gallery, he started, and said hastily—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take away that light, and begone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then shutting the door impetuously, he flung himself upon a bench against\n",
      "the wall, and bade Isabella sit by him. She obeyed trembling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sent for you, Lady,” said he—and then stopped under great appearance\n",
      "of confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Lord!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I sent for you on a matter of great moment,” resumed he. “Dry your\n",
      "tears, young Lady—you have lost your bridegroom. Yes, cruel fate! and I\n",
      "have lost the hopes of my race! But Conrad was not worthy of your\n",
      "beauty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How, my Lord!” said Isabella; “sure you do not suspect me of not feeling\n",
      "the concern I ought: my duty and affection would have always—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Think no more of him,” interrupted Manfred; “he was a sickly, puny\n",
      "child, and Heaven has perhaps taken him away, that I might not trust the\n",
      "honours of my house on so frail a foundation. The line of Manfred calls\n",
      "for numerous supports. My foolish fondness for that boy blinded the eyes\n",
      "of my prudence—but it is better as it is. I hope, in a few years, to\n",
      "have reason to rejoice at the death of Conrad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Words cannot paint the astonishment of Isabella. At first she\n",
      "apprehended that grief had disordered Manfred’s understanding. Her next\n",
      "thought suggested that this strange discourse was designed to ensnare\n",
      "her: she feared that Manfred had perceived her indifference for his son:\n",
      "and in consequence of that idea she replied—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good my Lord, do not doubt my tenderness: my heart would have\n",
      "accompanied my hand. Conrad would have engrossed all my care; and\n",
      "wherever fate shall dispose of me, I shall always cherish his memory, and\n",
      "regard your Highness and the virtuous Hippolita as my parents.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Curse on Hippolita!” cried Manfred. “Forget her from this moment, as I\n",
      "do. In short, Lady, you have missed a husband undeserving of your\n",
      "charms: they shall now be better disposed of. Instead of a sickly boy,\n",
      "you shall have a husband in the prime of his age, who will know how to\n",
      "value your beauties, and who may expect a numerous offspring.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas, my Lord!” said Isabella, “my mind is too sadly engrossed by the\n",
      "recent catastrophe in your family to think of another marriage. If ever\n",
      "my father returns, and it shall be his pleasure, I shall obey, as I did\n",
      "when I consented to give my hand to your son: but until his return,\n",
      "permit me to remain under your hospitable roof, and employ the melancholy\n",
      "hours in assuaging yours, Hippolita’s, and the fair Matilda’s\n",
      "affliction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I desired you once before,” said Manfred angrily, “not to name that\n",
      "woman: from this hour she must be a stranger to you, as she must be to\n",
      "me. In short, Isabella, since I cannot give you my son, I offer you\n",
      "myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heavens!” cried Isabella, waking from her delusion, “what do I hear?\n",
      "You! my Lord! You! My father-in-law! the father of Conrad! the husband\n",
      "of the virtuous and tender Hippolita!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I tell you,” said Manfred imperiously, “Hippolita is no longer my wife;\n",
      "I divorce her from this hour. Too long has she cursed me by her\n",
      "unfruitfulness. My fate depends on having sons, and this night I trust\n",
      "will give a new date to my hopes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At those words he seized the cold hand of Isabella, who was half dead\n",
      "with fright and horror. She shrieked, and started from him, Manfred rose\n",
      "to pursue her, when the moon, which was now up, and gleamed in at the\n",
      "opposite casement, presented to his sight the plumes of the fatal helmet,\n",
      "which rose to the height of the windows, waving backwards and forwards in\n",
      "a tempestuous manner, and accompanied with a hollow and rustling sound.\n",
      "Isabella, who gathered courage from her situation, and who dreaded\n",
      "nothing so much as Manfred’s pursuit of his declaration, cried—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look, my Lord! see, Heaven itself declares against your impious\n",
      "intentions!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heaven nor Hell shall impede my designs,” said Manfred, advancing again\n",
      "to seize the Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that instant the portrait of his grandfather, which hung over the\n",
      "bench where they had been sitting, uttered a deep sigh, and heaved its\n",
      "breast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabella, whose back was turned to the picture, saw not the motion, nor\n",
      "knew whence the sound came, but started, and said—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hark, my Lord! What sound was that?” and at the same time made towards\n",
      "the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, distracted between the flight of Isabella, who had now reached\n",
      "the stairs, and yet unable to keep his eyes from the picture, which began\n",
      "to move, had, however, advanced some steps after her, still looking\n",
      "backwards on the portrait, when he saw it quit its panel, and descend on\n",
      "the floor with a grave and melancholy air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do I dream?” cried Manfred, returning; “or are the devils themselves in\n",
      "league against me? Speak, infernal spectre! Or, if thou art my\n",
      "grandsire, why dost thou too conspire against thy wretched descendant,\n",
      "who too dearly pays for—” Ere he could finish the sentence, the vision\n",
      "sighed again, and made a sign to Manfred to follow him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lead on!” cried Manfred; “I will follow thee to the gulf of perdition.”\n",

      "The spectre marched sedately, but dejected, to the end of the gallery,\n",
      "and turned into a chamber on the right hand. Manfred accompanied him at\n",
      "a little distance, full of anxiety and horror, but resolved. As he would\n",
      "have entered the chamber, the door was clapped to with violence by an\n",
      "invisible hand. The Prince, collecting courage from this delay, would\n",
      "have forcibly burst open the door with his foot, but found that it\n",
      "resisted his utmost efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since Hell will not satisfy my curiosity,” said Manfred, “I will use the\n",
      "human means in my power for preserving my race; Isabella shall not escape\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The lady, whose resolution had given way to terror the moment she had\n",
      "quitted Manfred, continued her flight to the bottom of the principal\n",
      "staircase. There she stopped, not knowing whither to direct her steps,\n",
      "nor how to escape from the impetuosity of the Prince. The gates of the\n",
      "castle, she knew, were locked, and guards placed in the court. Should\n",
      "she, as her heart prompted her, go and prepare Hippolita for the cruel\n",
      "destiny that awaited her, she did not doubt but Manfred would seek her\n",
      "there, and that his violence would incite him to double the injury he\n",
      "meditated, without leaving room for them to avoid the impetuosity of his\n",
      "passions. Delay might give him time to reflect on the horrid measures he\n",
      "had conceived, or produce some circumstance in her favour, if she\n",
      "could—for that night, at least—avoid his odious purpose. Yet where\n",
      "conceal herself? How avoid the pursuit he would infallibly make\n",
      "throughout the castle?\n",
      "\n",
      "As these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind, she recollected a\n",
      "subterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the\n",
      "church of St. Nicholas. Could she reach the altar before she was\n",
      "overtaken, she knew even Manfred’s violence would not dare to profane the\n",
      "sacredness of the place; and she determined, if no other means of\n",
      "deliverance offered, to shut herself up for ever among the holy virgins\n",
      "whose convent was contiguous to the cathedral. In this resolution, she\n",
      "seized a lamp that burned at the foot of the staircase, and hurried\n",
      "towards the secret passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate\n",
      "cloisters; and it was not easy for one under so much anxiety to find the\n",
      "door that opened into the cavern. An awful silence reigned throughout\n",
      "those subterraneous regions, except now and then some blasts of wind that\n",
      "shook the doors she had passed, and which, grating on the rusty hinges,\n",
      "were re-echoed through that long labyrinth of darkness. Every murmur\n",
      "struck her with new terror; yet more she dreaded to hear the wrathful\n",
      "voice of Manfred urging his domestics to pursue her.\n",
      "\n",
      "She trod as softly as impatience would give her leave, yet frequently\n",
      "stopped and listened to hear if she was followed. In one of those\n",
      "moments she thought she heard a sigh. She shuddered, and recoiled a few\n",
      "paces. In a moment she thought she heard the step of some person. Her\n",
      "blood curdled; she concluded it was Manfred. Every suggestion that\n",
      "horror could inspire rushed into her mind. She condemned her rash\n",
      "flight, which had thus exposed her to his rage in a place where her cries\n",
      "were not likely to draw anybody to her assistance. Yet the sound seemed\n",
      "not to come from behind. If Manfred knew where she was, he must have\n",
      "followed her. She was still in one of the cloisters, and the steps she\n",
      "had heard were too distinct to proceed from the way she had come.\n",
      "Cheered with this reflection, and hoping to find a friend in whoever was\n",
      "not the Prince, she was going to advance, when a door that stood ajar, at\n",
      "some distance to the left, was opened gently: but ere her lamp, which she\n",
      "held up, could discover who opened it, the person retreated precipitately\n",
      "on seeing the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabella, whom every incident was sufficient to dismay, hesitated whether\n",
      "she should proceed. Her dread of Manfred soon outweighed every other\n",
      "terror. The very circumstance of the person avoiding her gave her a sort\n",
      "of courage. It could only be, she thought, some domestic belonging to\n",
      "the castle. Her gentleness had never raised her an enemy, and conscious\n",
      "innocence made her hope that, unless sent by the Prince’s order to seek\n",
      "her, his servants would rather assist than prevent her flight.\n",
      "Fortifying herself with these reflections, and believing by what she\n",
      "could observe that she was near the mouth of the subterraneous cavern,\n",
      "she approached the door that had been opened; but a sudden gust of wind\n",
      "that met her at the door extinguished her lamp, and left her in total\n",
      "darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Words cannot paint the horror of the Princess’s situation. Alone in so\n",
      "dismal a place, her mind imprinted with all the terrible events of the\n",
      "day, hopeless of escaping, expecting every moment the arrival of Manfred,\n",
      "and far from tranquil on knowing she was within reach of somebody, she\n",
      "knew not whom, who for some cause seemed concealed thereabouts; all these\n",
      "thoughts crowded on her distracted mind, and she was ready to sink under\n",
      "her apprehensions. She addressed herself to every saint in heaven, and\n",
      "inwardly implored their assistance. For a considerable time she remained\n",
      "in an agony of despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, as softly as was possible, she felt for the door, and having\n",
      "found it, entered trembling into the vault from whence she had heard the\n",
      "sigh and steps. It gave her a kind of momentary joy to perceive an\n",
      "imperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam from the roof of the vault,\n",
      "which seemed to be fallen in, and from whence hung a fragment of earth or\n",
      "building, she could not distinguish which, that appeared to have been\n",
      "crushed inwards. She advanced eagerly towards this chasm, when she\n",
      "discerned a human form standing close against the wall.\n",
      "\n",
      "She shrieked, believing it the ghost of her betrothed Conrad. The\n",
      "figure, advancing, said, in a submissive voice—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be not alarmed, Lady; I will not injure you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabella, a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the\n",
      "stranger, and recollecting that this must be the person who had opened\n",
      "the door, recovered her spirits enough to reply—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir, whoever you are, take pity on a wretched Princess, standing on the\n",
      "brink of destruction. Assist me to escape from this fatal castle, or in\n",
      "a few moments I may be made miserable for ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas!” said the stranger, “what can I do to assist you? I will die in\n",
      "your defence; but I am unacquainted with the castle, and want—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said Isabella, hastily interrupting him; “help me but to find a\n",
      "trap-door that must be hereabout, and it is the greatest service you can\n",
      "do me, for I have not a minute to lose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Saying these words, she felt about on the pavement, and directed the\n",
      "stranger to search likewise, for a smooth piece of brass enclosed in\n",
      "one of the stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That,” said she, “is the lock, which opens with a spring, of which I\n",
      "know the secret. If we can find that, I may escape—if not, alas!\n",
      "courteous stranger, I fear I shall have involved you in my misfortunes:\n",
      "Manfred will suspect you for the accomplice of my flight, and you will\n",
      "fall a victim to his resentment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I value not my life,” said the stranger, “and it will be some comfort to\n",
      "lose it in trying to deliver you from his tyranny.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Generous youth,” said Isabella, “how shall I ever requite—”\n",
      "\n",
      "As she uttered those words, a ray of moonshine, streaming through a\n",
      "cranny of the ruin above, shone directly on the lock they sought.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! transport!” said Isabella; “here is the trap-door!” and, taking out\n",
      "the key, she touched the spring, which, starting aside, discovered an\n",
      "iron ring. “Lift up the door,” said the Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger obeyed, and beneath appeared some stone steps descending\n",
      "into a vault totally dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We must go down here,” said Isabella. “Follow me; dark and dismal as it\n",
      "is, we cannot miss our way; it leads directly to the church of St.\n",
      "Nicholas. But, perhaps,” added the Princess modestly, “you have no\n",
      "reason to leave the castle, nor have I farther occasion for your service;\n",
      "in a few minutes I shall be safe from Manfred’s rage—only let me know to\n",
      "whom I am so much obliged.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will never quit you,” said the stranger eagerly, “until I have placed\n",
      "you in safety—nor think me, Princess, more generous than I am; though you\n",
      "are my principal care—”\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger was interrupted by a sudden noise of voices that seemed\n",
      "approaching, and they soon distinguished these words—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Talk not to me of necromancers; I tell you she must be in the castle; I\n",
      "will find her in spite of enchantment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, heavens!” cried Isabella; “it is the voice of Manfred! Make haste,\n",
      "or we are ruined! and shut the trap-door after you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Saying this, she descended the steps precipitately; and as the stranger\n",
      "hastened to follow her, he let the door slip out of his hands: it fell,\n",
      "and the spring closed over it. He tried in vain to open it, not having\n",
      "observed Isabella’s method of touching the spring; nor had he many\n",
      "moments to make an essay. The noise of the falling door had been heard\n",
      "by Manfred, who, directed by the sound, hastened thither, attended by his\n",
      "servants with torches.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It must be Isabella,” cried Manfred, before he entered the vault. “She\n",
      "is escaping by the subterraneous passage, but she cannot have got far.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the astonishment of the Prince when, instead of Isabella, the\n",
      "light of the torches discovered to him the young peasant whom he thought\n",
      "confined under the fatal helmet!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Traitor!” said Manfred; “how camest thou here? I thought thee in\n",
      "durance above in the court.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am no traitor,” replied the young man boldly, “nor am I answerable for\n",
      "your thoughts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Presumptuous villain!” cried Manfred; “dost thou provoke my wrath? Tell\n",
      "me, how hast thou escaped from above? Thou hast corrupted thy guards,\n",
      "and their lives shall answer it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My poverty,” said the peasant calmly, “will disculpate them: though the\n",
      "ministers of a tyrant’s wrath, to thee they are faithful, and but too\n",
      "willing to execute the orders which you unjustly imposed upon them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Art thou so hardy as to dare my vengeance?” said the Prince; “but\n",
      "tortures shall force the truth from thee. Tell me; I will know thy\n",
      "accomplices.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There was my accomplice!” said the youth, smiling, and pointing to the\n",
      "roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred ordered the torches to be held up, and perceived that one of the\n",
      "cheeks of the enchanted casque had forced its way through the pavement of\n",
      "the court, as his servants had let it fall over the peasant, and had\n",
      "broken through into the vault, leaving a gap, through which the peasant\n",
      "had pressed himself some minutes before he was found by Isabella.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Was that the way by which thou didst descend?” said Manfred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was,” said the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what noise was that,” said Manfred, “which I heard as I entered the\n",
      "cloister?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A door clapped,” said the peasant; “I heard it as well as you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What door?” said Manfred hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not acquainted with your castle,” said the peasant; “this is the\n",
      "first time I ever entered it, and this vault the only part of it within\n",
      "which I ever was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I tell thee,” said Manfred (wishing to find out if the youth had\n",
      "discovered the trap-door), “it was this way I heard the noise. My\n",
      "servants heard it too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Lord,” interrupted one of them officiously, “to be sure it was the\n",
      "trap-door, and he was going to make his escape.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peace, blockhead!” said the Prince angrily; “if he was going to escape,\n",
      "how should he come on this side? I will know from his own mouth what\n",
      "noise it was I heard. Tell me truly; thy life depends on thy veracity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My veracity is dearer to me than my life,” said the peasant; “nor would\n",
      "I purchase the one by forfeiting the other.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed, young philosopher!” said Manfred contemptuously; “tell me, then,\n",
      "what was the noise I heard?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ask me what I can answer,” said he, “and put me to death instantly if I\n",
      "tell you a lie.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, growing impatient at the steady valour and indifference of the\n",
      "youth, cried—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, thou man of truth, answer! Was it the fall of the trap-door\n",
      "that I heard?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was,” said the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was!” said the Prince; “and how didst thou come to know there was a\n",
      "trap-door here?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I saw the plate of brass by a gleam of moonshine,” replied he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But what told thee it was a lock?” said Manfred. “How didst thou\n",
      "discover the secret of opening it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Providence, that delivered me from the helmet, was able to direct me to\n",
      "the spring of a lock,” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Providence should have gone a little farther, and have placed thee out\n",
      "of the reach of my resentment,” said Manfred. “When Providence had\n",
      "taught thee to open the lock, it abandoned thee for a fool, who did not\n",
      "know how to make use of its favours. Why didst thou not pursue the path\n",
      "pointed out for thy escape? Why didst thou shut the trap-door before\n",
      "thou hadst descended the steps?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I might ask you, my Lord,” said the peasant, “how I, totally\n",
      "unacquainted with your castle, was to know that those steps led to any\n",
      "outlet? but I scorn to evade your questions. Wherever those steps lead\n",
      "to, perhaps I should have explored the way—I could not be in a worse\n",
      "situation than I was. But the truth is, I let the trap-door fall: your\n",
      "immediate arrival followed. I had given the alarm—what imported it to me\n",
      "whether I was seized a minute sooner or a minute later?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art a resolute villain for thy years,” said Manfred; “yet on\n",
      "reflection I suspect thou dost but trifle with me. Thou hast not yet\n",
      "told me how thou didst open the lock.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That I will show you, my Lord,” said the peasant; and, taking up a\n",
      "fragment of stone that had fallen from above, he laid himself on the\n",
      "trap-door, and began to beat on the piece of brass that covered it,\n",
      "meaning to gain time for the escape of the Princess. This presence of\n",
      "mind, joined to the frankness of the youth, staggered Manfred. He even\n",
      "felt a disposition towards pardoning one who had been guilty of no crime.\n",
      "Manfred was not one of those savage tyrants who wanton in cruelty\n",
      "unprovoked. The circumstances of his fortune had given an asperity to\n",
      "his temper, which was naturally humane; and his virtues were always ready\n",
      "to operate, when his passions did not obscure his reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the Prince was in this suspense, a confused noise of voices echoed\n",
      "through the distant vaults. As the sound approached, he distinguished\n",
      "the clamours of some of his domestics, whom he had dispersed through the\n",
      "castle in search of Isabella, calling out—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is my Lord? where is the Prince?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Here I am,” said Manfred, as they came nearer; “have you found the\n",
      "Princess?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The first that arrived, replied, “Oh, my Lord! I am glad we have found\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Found me!” said Manfred; “have you found the Princess?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We thought we had, my Lord,” said the fellow, looking terrified, “but—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But, what?” cried the Prince; “has she escaped?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jaquez and I, my Lord—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I and Diego,” interrupted the second, who came up in still greater\n",
      "consternation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak one of you at a time,” said Manfred; “I ask you, where is the\n",
      "Princess?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do not know,” said they both together; “but we are frightened out of\n",
      "our wits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So I think, blockheads,” said Manfred; “what is it has scared you thus?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! my Lord,” said Jaquez, “Diego has seen such a sight! your Highness\n",
      "would not believe our eyes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What new absurdity is this?” cried Manfred; “give me a direct answer,\n",
      "or, by Heaven—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, my Lord, if it please your Highness to hear me,” said the poor\n",
      "fellow, “Diego and I—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, I and Jaquez—” cried his comrade.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did not I forbid you to speak both at a time?” said the Prince: “you,\n",
      "Jaquez, answer; for the other fool seems more distracted than thou art;\n",
      "what is the matter?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My gracious Lord,” said Jaquez, “if it please your Highness to hear me;\n",
      "Diego and I, according to your Highness’s orders, went to search for the\n",
      "young Lady; but being comprehensive that we might meet the ghost of my\n",
      "young Lord, your Highness’s son, God rest his soul, as he has not\n",
      "received Christian burial—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sot!” cried Manfred in a rage; “is it only a ghost, then, that thou hast\n",
      "seen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! worse! worse! my Lord,” cried Diego: “I had rather have seen ten\n",
      "whole ghosts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Grant me patience!” said Manfred; “these blockheads distract me. Out of\n",
      "my sight, Diego! and thou, Jaquez, tell me in one word, art thou sober?\n",
      "art thou raving? thou wast wont to have some sense: has the other sot\n",
      "frightened himself and thee too? Speak; what is it he fancies he has\n",
      "seen?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, my Lord,” replied Jaquez, trembling, “I was going to tell your\n",
      "Highness, that since the calamitous misfortune of my young Lord, God rest\n",
      "his precious soul! not one of us your Highness’s faithful servants—indeed\n",
      "we are, my Lord, though poor men—I say, not one of us has dared to set a\n",
      "foot about the castle, but two together: so Diego and I, thinking that my\n",
      "young Lady might be in the great gallery, went up there to look for her,\n",
      "and tell her your Highness wanted something to impart to her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“O blundering fools!” cried Manfred; “and in the meantime, she has made\n",
      "her escape, because you were afraid of goblins!—Why, thou knave! she left\n",
      "me in the gallery; I came from thence myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For all that, she may be there still for aught I know,” said Jaquez;\n",
      "“but the devil shall have me before I seek her there again—poor Diego! I\n",
      "do not believe he will ever recover it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Recover what?” said Manfred; “am I never to learn what it is has\n",
      "terrified these rascals?—but I lose my time; follow me, slave; I will see\n",
      "if she is in the gallery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For Heaven’s sake, my dear, good Lord,” cried Jaquez, “do not go to the\n",
      "gallery. Satan himself I believe is in the chamber next to the gallery.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, who hitherto had treated the terror of his servants as an idle\n",
      "panic, was struck at this new circumstance. He recollected the\n",
      "apparition of the portrait, and the sudden closing of the door at the end\n",
      "of the gallery. His voice faltered, and he asked with disorder—\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is in the great chamber?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Lord,” said Jaquez, “when Diego and I came into the gallery, he went\n",
      "first, for he said he had more courage than I. So when we came into the\n",
      "gallery we found nobody. We looked under every bench and stool; and\n",
      "still we found nobody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Were all the pictures in their places?” said Manfred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, my Lord,” answered Jaquez; “but we did not think of looking behind\n",
      "them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, well!” said Manfred; “proceed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“When we came to the door of the great chamber,” continued Jaquez, “we\n",
      "found it shut.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And could not you open it?” said Manfred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! yes, my Lord; would to Heaven we had not!” replied he—“nay, it was\n",
      "not I neither; it was Diego: he was grown foolhardy, and would go on,\n",
      "though I advised him not—if ever I open a door that is shut again—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trifle not,” said Manfred, shuddering, “but tell me what you saw in the\n",
      "great chamber on opening the door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I, my Lord!” said Jaquez; “I was behind Diego; but I heard the noise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jaquez,” said Manfred, in a solemn tone of voice; “tell me, I adjure\n",
      "thee by the souls of my ancestors, what was it thou sawest? what was it\n",
      "thou heardest?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was Diego saw it, my Lord, it was not I,” replied Jaquez; “I only\n",
      "heard the noise. Diego had no sooner opened the door, than he cried out,\n",
      "and ran back. I ran back too, and said, ‘Is it the ghost?’ ‘The ghost!\n",
      "no, no,’ said Diego, and his hair stood on end—‘it is a giant, I believe;\n",
      "he is all clad in armour, for I saw his foot and part of his leg, and\n",
      "they are as large as the helmet below in the court.’ As he said these\n",
      "words, my Lord, we heard a violent motion and the rattling of armour, as\n",
      "if the giant was rising, for Diego has told me since that he believes the\n",
      "giant was lying down, for the foot and leg were stretched at length on\n",
      "the floor. Before we could get to the end of the gallery, we heard the\n",
      "door of the great chamber clap behind us, but we did not dare turn back\n",
      "to see if the giant was following us—yet, now I think on it, we must have\n",
      "heard him if he had pursued us—but for Heaven’s sake, good my Lord, send\n",
      "for the chaplain, and have the castle exorcised, for, for certain, it is\n",
      "enchanted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ay, pray do, my Lord,” cried all the servants at once, “or we must leave\n",
      "your Highness’s service.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peace, dotards!” said Manfred, “and follow me; I will know what all this\n",
      "means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We! my Lord!” cried they with one voice; “we would not go up to the\n",
      "gallery for your Highness’s revenue.” The young peasant, who had stood\n",
      "silent, now spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will your Highness,” said he, “permit me to try this adventure? My life\n",
      "is of consequence to nobody; I fear no bad angel, and have offended no\n",
      "good one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your behaviour is above your seeming,” said Manfred, viewing him with\n",
      "surprise and admiration—“hereafter I will reward your bravery—but now,”\n",
      "continued he with a sigh, “I am so circumstanced, that I dare trust no\n",
      "eyes but my own. However, I give you leave to accompany me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, when he first followed Isabella from the gallery, had gone\n",
      "directly to the apartment of his wife, concluding the Princess had\n",
      "retired thither. Hippolita, who knew his step, rose with anxious\n",
      "fondness to meet her Lord, whom she had not seen since the death of their\n",
      "son. She would have flown in a transport mixed of joy and grief to his\n",
      "bosom, but he pushed her rudely off, and said—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is Isabella?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isabella! my Lord!” said the astonished Hippolita.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Isabella,” cried Manfred imperiously; “I want Isabella.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Lord,” replied Matilda, who perceived how much his behaviour had\n",
      "shocked her mother, “she has not been with us since your Highness\n",
      "summoned her to your apartment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tell me where she is,” said the Prince; “I do not want to know where she\n",
      "has been.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My good Lord,” says Hippolita, “your daughter tells you the truth:\n",
      "Isabella left us by your command, and has not returned since;—but, my\n",
      "good Lord, compose yourself: retire to your rest: this dismal day has\n",
      "disordered you. Isabella shall wait your orders in the morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, then, you know where she is!” cried Manfred. “Tell me directly,\n",
      "for I will not lose an instant—and you, woman,” speaking to his wife,\n",
      "“order your chaplain to attend me forthwith.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isabella,” said Hippolita calmly, “is retired, I suppose, to her\n",
      "chamber: she is not accustomed to watch at this late hour. Gracious my\n",
      "Lord,” continued she, “let me know what has disturbed you. Has Isabella\n",
      "offended you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Trouble me not with questions,” said Manfred, “but tell me where she\n",
      "is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Matilda shall call her,” said the Princess. “Sit down, my Lord, and\n",
      "resume your wonted fortitude.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, art thou jealous of Isabella?” replied he, “that you wish to be\n",
      "present at our interview!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good heavens! my Lord,” said Hippolita, “what is it your Highness\n",
      "means?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou wilt know ere many minutes are passed,” said the cruel Prince.\n",
      "“Send your chaplain to me, and wait my pleasure here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At these words he flung out of the room in search of Isabella, leaving\n",
      "the amazed ladies thunderstruck with his words and frantic deportment,\n",
      "and lost in vain conjectures on what he was meditating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred was now returning from the vault, attended by the peasant and a\n",
      "few of his servants whom he had obliged to accompany him. He ascended\n",
      "the staircase without stopping till he arrived at the gallery, at the\n",
      "door of which he met Hippolita and her chaplain. When Diego had been\n",
      "dismissed by Manfred, he had gone directly to the Princess’s apartment\n",
      "with the alarm of what he had seen. That excellent Lady, who no more\n",
      "than Manfred doubted of the reality of the vision, yet affected to treat\n",
      "it as a delirium of the servant. Willing, however, to save her Lord from\n",
      "any additional shock, and prepared by a series of griefs not to tremble\n",
      "at any accession to it, she determined to make herself the first\n",
      "sacrifice, if fate had marked the present hour for their destruction.\n",
      "Dismissing the reluctant Matilda to her rest, who in vain sued for leave\n",
      "to accompany her mother, and attended only by her chaplain, Hippolita had\n",
      "visited the gallery and great chamber; and now with more serenity of soul\n",
      "than she had felt for many hours, she met her Lord, and assured him that\n",
      "the vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all a fable; and no doubt an\n",
      "impression made by fear, and the dark and dismal hour of the night, on\n",
      "the minds of his servants. She and the chaplain had examined the\n",
      "chamber, and found everything in the usual order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, though persuaded, like his wife, that the vision had been no\n",
      "work of fancy, recovered a little from the tempest of mind into which so\n",
      "many strange events had thrown him. Ashamed, too, of his inhuman\n",
      "treatment of a Princess who returned every injury with new marks of\n",
      "tenderness and duty, he felt returning love forcing itself into his eyes;\n",
      "but not less ashamed of feeling remorse towards one against whom he was\n",
      "inwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage, he curbed the yearnings of\n",
      "his heart, and did not dare to lean even towards pity. The next\n",
      "transition of his soul was to exquisite villainy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presuming on the unshaken submission of Hippolita, he flattered himself\n",
      "that she would not only acquiesce with patience to a divorce, but would\n",
      "obey, if it was his pleasure, in endeavouring to persuade Isabella to\n",
      "give him her hand—but ere he could indulge his horrid hope, he reflected\n",
      "that Isabella was not to be found. Coming to himself, he gave orders\n",
      "that every avenue to the castle should be strictly guarded, and charged\n",
      "his domestics on pain of their lives to suffer nobody to pass out. The\n",
      "young peasant, to whom he spoke favourably, he ordered to remain in a\n",
      "small chamber on the stairs, in which there was a pallet-bed, and the key\n",
      "of which he took away himself, telling the youth he would talk with him\n",
      "in the morning. Then dismissing his attendants, and bestowing a sullen\n",
      "kind of half-nod on Hippolita, he retired to his own chamber.\n",

      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Matilda, who by Hippolita’s order had retired to her apartment, was\n",
      "ill-disposed to take any rest. The shocking fate of her brother had\n",
      "deeply affected her. She was surprised at not seeing Isabella; but the\n",
      "strange words which had fallen from her father, and his obscure menace to\n",
      "the Princess his wife, accompanied by the most furious behaviour, had\n",
      "filled her gentle mind with terror and alarm. She waited anxiously for\n",
      "the return of Bianca, a young damsel that attended her, whom she had sent\n",
      "to learn what was become of Isabella. Bianca soon appeared, and informed\n",
      "her mistress of what she had gathered from the servants, that Isabella\n",
      "was nowhere to be found. She related the adventure of the young peasant\n",
      "who had been discovered in the vault, though with many simple additions\n",
      "from the incoherent accounts of the domestics; and she dwelt principally\n",
      "on the gigantic leg and foot which had been seen in the gallery-chamber.\n",
      "This last circumstance had terrified Bianca so much, that she was\n",
      "rejoiced when Matilda told her that she would not go to rest, but would\n",
      "watch till the Princess should rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young Princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight of\n",
      "Isabella, and on the threats of Manfred to her mother. “But what\n",
      "business could he have so urgent with the chaplain?” said Matilda, “Does\n",
      "he intend to have my brother’s body interred privately in the chapel?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, Madam!” said Bianca, “now I guess. As you are become his heiress,\n",
      "he is impatient to have you married: he has always been raving for more\n",
      "sons; I warrant he is now impatient for grandsons. As sure as I live,\n",
      "Madam, I shall see you a bride at last.—Good madam, you won’t cast off\n",
      "your faithful Bianca: you won’t put Donna Rosara over me now you are a\n",
      "great Princess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My poor Bianca,” said Matilda, “how fast your thoughts amble! I a great\n",
      "princess! What hast thou seen in Manfred’s behaviour since my brother’s\n",
      "death that bespeaks any increase of tenderness to me? No, Bianca; his\n",
      "heart was ever a stranger to me—but he is my father, and I must not\n",
      "complain. Nay, if Heaven shuts my father’s heart against me, it overpays\n",
      "my little merit in the tenderness of my mother—O that dear mother! yes,\n",
      "Bianca, ’tis there I feel the rugged temper of Manfred. I can support\n",
      "his harshness to me with patience; but it wounds my soul when I am\n",
      "witness to his causeless severity towards her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Madam,” said Bianca, “all men use their wives so, when they are\n",
      "weary of them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And yet you congratulated me but now,” said Matilda, “when you fancied\n",
      "my father intended to dispose of me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would have you a great Lady,” replied Bianca, “come what will. I do\n",
      "not wish to see you moped in a convent, as you would be if you had your\n",
      "will, and if my Lady, your mother, who knows that a bad husband is better\n",
      "than no husband at all, did not hinder you.—Bless me! what noise is that!\n",
      "St. Nicholas forgive me! I was but in jest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is the wind,” said Matilda, “whistling through the battlements in the\n",
      "tower above: you have heard it a thousand times.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay,” said Bianca, “there was no harm neither in what I said: it is no\n",
      "sin to talk of matrimony—and so, Madam, as I was saying, if my Lord\n",
      "Manfred should offer you a handsome young Prince for a bridegroom, you\n",
      "would drop him a curtsey, and tell him you would rather take the veil?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank Heaven! I am in no such danger,” said Matilda: “you know how many\n",
      "proposals for me he has rejected—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you thank him, like a dutiful daughter, do you, Madam? But come,\n",
      "Madam; suppose, to-morrow morning, he was to send for you to the great\n",
      "council chamber, and there you should find at his elbow a lovely young\n",
      "Prince, with large black eyes, a smooth white forehead, and manly curling\n",
      "locks like jet; in short, Madam, a young hero resembling the picture of\n",
      "the good Alfonso in the gallery, which you sit and gaze at for hours\n",
      "together—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not speak lightly of that picture,” interrupted Matilda sighing; “I\n",
      "know the adoration with which I look at that picture is uncommon—but I am\n",
      "not in love with a coloured panel. The character of that virtuous\n",
      "Prince, the veneration with which my mother has inspired me for his\n",
      "memory, the orisons which, I know not why, she has enjoined me to pour\n",
      "forth at his tomb, all have concurred to persuade me that somehow or\n",
      "other my destiny is linked with something relating to him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord, Madam! how should that be?” said Bianca; “I have always heard that\n",
      "your family was in no way related to his: and I am sure I cannot conceive\n",
      "why my Lady, the Princess, sends you in a cold morning or a damp evening\n",
      "to pray at his tomb: he is no saint by the almanack. If you must pray,\n",
      "why does she not bid you address yourself to our great St. Nicholas? I\n",
      "am sure he is the saint I pray to for a husband.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps my mind would be less affected,” said Matilda, “if my mother\n",
      "would explain her reasons to me: but it is the mystery she observes, that\n",
      "inspires me with this—I know not what to call it. As she never acts from\n",
      "caprice, I am sure there is some fatal secret at bottom—nay, I know there\n",
      "is: in her agony of grief for my brother’s death she dropped some words\n",
      "that intimated as much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! dear Madam,” cried Bianca, “what were they?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Matilda, “if a parent lets fall a word, and wishes it\n",
      "recalled, it is not for a child to utter it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! was she sorry for what she had said?” asked Bianca; “I am sure,\n",
      "Madam, you may trust me—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With my own little secrets when I have any, I may,” said Matilda; “but\n",
      "never with my mother’s: a child ought to have no ears or eyes but as a\n",
      "parent directs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! to be sure, Madam, you were born to be a saint,” said Bianca, “and\n",
      "there is no resisting one’s vocation: you will end in a convent at last.\n",
      "But there is my Lady Isabella would not be so reserved to me: she will\n",
      "let me talk to her of young men: and when a handsome cavalier has come to\n",
      "the castle, she has owned to me that she wished your brother Conrad\n",
      "resembled him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bianca,” said the Princess, “I do not allow you to mention my friend\n",
      "disrespectfully. Isabella is of a cheerful disposition, but her soul is\n",
      "pure as virtue itself. She knows your idle babbling humour, and perhaps\n",
      "has now and then encouraged it, to divert melancholy, and enliven the\n",
      "solitude in which my father keeps us—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Blessed Mary!” said Bianca, starting, “there it is again! Dear Madam,\n",
      "do you hear nothing? this castle is certainly haunted!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peace!” said Matilda, “and listen! I did think I heard a voice—but it\n",
      "must be fancy: your terrors, I suppose, have infected me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed! indeed! Madam,” said Bianca, half-weeping with agony, “I am\n",
      "sure I heard a voice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does anybody lie in the chamber beneath?” said the Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nobody has dared to lie there,” answered Bianca, “since the great\n",
      "astrologer, that was your brother’s tutor, drowned himself. For certain,\n",
      "Madam, his ghost and the young Prince’s are now met in the chamber\n",
      "below—for Heaven’s sake let us fly to your mother’s apartment!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I charge you not to stir,” said Matilda. “If they are spirits in pain,\n",
      "we may ease their sufferings by questioning them. They can mean no hurt\n",
      "to us, for we have not injured them—and if they should, shall we be more\n",
      "safe in one chamber than in another? Reach me my beads; we will say a\n",
      "prayer, and then speak to them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! dear Lady, I would not speak to a ghost for the world!” cried\n",
      "Bianca. As she said those words they heard the casement of the little\n",
      "chamber below Matilda’s open. They listened attentively, and in a few\n",
      "minutes thought they heard a person sing, but could not distinguish the\n",
      "words.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This can be no evil spirit,” said the Princess, in a low voice; “it is\n",
      "undoubtedly one of the family—open the window, and we shall know the\n",
      "voice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I dare not, indeed, Madam,” said Bianca.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art a very fool,” said Matilda, opening the window gently herself.\n",
      "The noise the Princess made was, however, heard by the person beneath,\n",
      "who stopped; and they concluded had heard the casement open.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is anybody below?” said the Princess; “if there is, speak.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said an unknown voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is it?” said Matilda.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A stranger,” replied the voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What stranger?” said she; “and how didst thou come there at this unusual\n",
      "hour, when all the gates of the castle are locked?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not here willingly,” answered the voice. “But pardon me, Lady, if\n",
      "I have disturbed your rest; I knew not that I was overheard. Sleep had\n",
      "forsaken me; I left a restless couch, and came to waste the irksome hours\n",
      "with gazing on the fair approach of morning, impatient to be dismissed\n",
      "from this castle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thy words and accents,” said Matilda, “are of melancholy cast; if thou\n",
      "art unhappy, I pity thee. If poverty afflicts thee, let me know it; I\n",
      "will mention thee to the Princess, whose beneficent soul ever melts for\n",
      "the distressed, and she will relieve thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am indeed unhappy,” said the stranger; “and I know not what wealth is.\n",
      "But I do not complain of the lot which Heaven has cast for me; I am young\n",
      "and healthy, and am not ashamed of owing my support to myself—yet think\n",
      "me not proud, or that I disdain your generous offers. I will remember\n",
      "you in my orisons, and will pray for blessings on your gracious self and\n",
      "your noble mistress—if I sigh, Lady, it is for others, not for myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now I have it, Madam,” said Bianca, whispering the Princess; “this is\n",
      "certainly the young peasant; and, by my conscience, he is in love—Well!\n",
      "this is a charming adventure!—do, Madam, let us sift him. He does not\n",
      "know you, but takes you for one of my Lady Hippolita’s women.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Art thou not ashamed, Bianca!” said the Princess. “What right have we\n",
      "to pry into the secrets of this young man’s heart? He seems virtuous and\n",
      "frank, and tells us he is unhappy. Are those circumstances that\n",
      "authorise us to make a property of him? How are we entitled to his\n",
      "confidence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord, Madam! how little you know of love!” replied Bianca; “why, lovers\n",
      "have no pleasure equal to talking of their mistress.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And would you have _me_ become a peasant’s confidante?” said the\n",
      "Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, let me talk to him,” said Bianca; “though I have the honour\n",
      "of being your Highness’s maid of honour, I was not always so great.\n",
      "Besides, if love levels ranks, it raises them too; I have a respect for\n",
      "any young man in love.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peace, simpleton!” said the Princess. “Though he said he was unhappy,\n",
      "it does not follow that he must be in love. Think of all that has\n",
      "happened to-day, and tell me if there are no misfortunes but what love\n",
      "causes.—Stranger,” resumed the Princess, “if thy misfortunes have not\n",
      "been occasioned by thy own fault, and are within the compass of the\n",
      "Princess Hippolita’s power to redress, I will take upon me to answer that\n",
      "she will be thy protectress. When thou art dismissed from this castle,\n",
      "repair to holy father Jerome, at the convent adjoining to the church of\n",
      "St. Nicholas, and make thy story known to him, as far as thou thinkest\n",
      "meet. He will not fail to inform the Princess, who is the mother of all\n",
      "that want her assistance. Farewell; it is not seemly for me to hold\n",
      "farther converse with a man at this unwonted hour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May the saints guard thee, gracious Lady!” replied the peasant; “but oh!\n",
      "if a poor and worthless stranger might presume to beg a minute’s audience\n",
      "farther; am I so happy? the casement is not shut; might I venture to\n",
      "ask—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak quickly,” said Matilda; “the morning dawns apace: should the\n",
      "labourers come into the fields and perceive us—What wouldst thou ask?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know not how, I know not if I dare,” said the young stranger,\n",
      "faltering; “yet the humanity with which you have spoken to me\n",
      "emboldens—Lady! dare I trust you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heavens!” said Matilda, “what dost thou mean? With what wouldst thou\n",
      "trust me? Speak boldly, if thy secret is fit to be entrusted to a\n",
      "virtuous breast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would ask,” said the peasant, recollecting himself, “whether what I\n",
      "have heard from the domestics is true, that the Princess is missing from\n",
      "the castle?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What imports it to thee to know?” replied Matilda. “Thy first words\n",
      "bespoke a prudent and becoming gravity. Dost thou come hither to pry\n",
      "into the secrets of Manfred? Adieu. I have been mistaken in thee.”\n",
      "Saying these words she shut the casement hastily, without giving the\n",
      "young man time to reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I had acted more wisely,” said the Princess to Bianca, with some\n",
      "sharpness, “if I had let thee converse with this peasant; his\n",
      "inquisitiveness seems of a piece with thy own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is not fit for me to argue with your Highness,” replied Bianca; “but\n",
      "perhaps the questions I should have put to him would have been more to\n",
      "the purpose than those you have been pleased to ask him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! no doubt,” said Matilda; “you are a very discreet personage! May I\n",
      "know what _you_ would have asked him?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A bystander often sees more of the game than those that play,” answered\n",
      "Bianca. “Does your Highness think, Madam, that this question about my\n",
      "Lady Isabella was the result of mere curiosity? No, no, Madam, there is\n",
      "more in it than you great folks are aware of. Lopez told me that all the\n",
      "servants believe this young fellow contrived my Lady Isabella’s escape;\n",
      "now, pray, Madam, observe you and I both know that my Lady Isabella never\n",
      "much fancied the Prince your brother. Well! he is killed just in a\n",
      "critical minute—I accuse nobody. A helmet falls from the moon—so, my\n",
      "Lord, your father says; but Lopez and all the servants say that this\n",
      "young spark is a magician, and stole it from Alfonso’s tomb—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have done with this rhapsody of impertinence,” said Matilda.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nay, Madam, as you please,” cried Bianca; “yet it is very particular\n",
      "though, that my Lady Isabella should be missing the very same day, and\n",
      "that this young sorcerer should be found at the mouth of the trap-door.\n",
      "I accuse nobody; but if my young Lord came honestly by his death—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dare not on thy duty,” said Matilda, “to breathe a suspicion on the\n",
      "purity of my dear Isabella’s fame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Purity, or not purity,” said Bianca, “gone she is—a stranger is found\n",
      "that nobody knows; you question him yourself; he tells you he is in love,\n",
      "or unhappy, it is the same thing—nay, he owned he was unhappy about\n",
      "others; and is anybody unhappy about another, unless they are in love\n",
      "with them? and at the very next word, he asks innocently, pour soul! if\n",
      "my Lady Isabella is missing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure,” said Matilda, “thy observations are not totally without\n",
      "foundation—Isabella’s flight amazes me. The curiosity of the stranger is\n",
      "very particular; yet Isabella never concealed a thought from me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So she told you,” said Bianca, “to fish out your secrets; but who knows,\n",
      "Madam, but this stranger may be some Prince in disguise? Do, Madam, let\n",
      "me open the window, and ask him a few questions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” replied Matilda, “I will ask him myself, if he knows aught of\n",
      "Isabella; he is not worthy I should converse farther with him.” She was\n",
      "going to open the casement, when they heard the bell ring at the\n",
      "postern-gate of the castle, which is on the right hand of the tower,\n",
      "where Matilda lay. This prevented the Princess from renewing the\n",
      "conversation with the stranger.\n",
      "\n",
      "After continuing silent for some time, “I am persuaded,” said she to\n",
      "Bianca, “that whatever be the cause of Isabella’s flight it had no\n",
      "unworthy motive. If this stranger was accessory to it, she must be\n",
      "satisfied with his fidelity and worth. I observed, did not you, Bianca?\n",
      "that his words were tinctured with an uncommon infusion of piety. It was\n",
      "no ruffian’s speech; his phrases were becoming a man of gentle birth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you, Madam,” said Bianca, “that I was sure he was some Prince in\n",
      "disguise.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yet,” said Matilda, “if he was privy to her escape, how will you account\n",
      "for his not accompanying her in her flight? why expose himself\n",
      "unnecessarily and rashly to my father’s resentment?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As for that, Madam,” replied she, “if he could get from under the\n",
      "helmet, he will find ways of eluding your father’s anger. I do not doubt\n",
      "but he has some talisman or other about him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You resolve everything into magic,” said Matilda; “but a man who has any\n",
      "intercourse with infernal spirits, does not dare to make use of those\n",
      "tremendous and holy words which he uttered. Didst thou not observe with\n",
      "what fervour he vowed to remember _me_ to heaven in his prayers? Yes;\n",
      "Isabella was undoubtedly convinced of his piety.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Commend me to the piety of a young fellow and a damsel that consult to\n",
      "elope!” said Bianca. “No, no, Madam, my Lady Isabella is of another\n",
      "guess mould than you take her for. She used indeed to sigh and lift up\n",
      "her eyes in your company, because she knows you are a saint; but when\n",
      "your back was turned—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You wrong her,” said Matilda; “Isabella is no hypocrite; she has a due\n",
      "sense of devotion, but never affected a call she has not. On the\n",
      "contrary, she always combated my inclination for the cloister; and though\n",
      "I own the mystery she has made to me of her flight confounds me; though\n",
      "it seems inconsistent with the friendship between us; I cannot forget the\n",
      "disinterested warmth with which she always opposed my taking the veil.\n",
      "She wished to see me married, though my dower would have been a loss to\n",
      "her and my brother’s children. For her sake I will believe well of this\n",
      "young peasant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you do think there is some liking between them,” said Bianca.\n",
      "While she was speaking, a servant came hastily into the chamber and told\n",
      "the Princess that the Lady Isabella was found.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where?” said Matilda.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She has taken sanctuary in St. Nicholas’s church,” replied the servant;\n",
      "“Father Jerome has brought the news himself; he is below with his\n",
      "Highness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is my mother?” said Matilda.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She is in her own chamber, Madam, and has asked for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred had risen at the first dawn of light, and gone to Hippolita’s\n",
      "apartment, to inquire if she knew aught of Isabella. While he was\n",
      "questioning her, word was brought that Jerome demanded to speak with him.\n",
      "Manfred, little suspecting the cause of the Friar’s arrival, and knowing\n",
      "he was employed by Hippolita in her charities, ordered him to be\n",
      "admitted, intending to leave them together, while he pursued his search\n",
      "after Isabella.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is your business with me or the Princess?” said Manfred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With both,” replied the holy man. “The Lady Isabella—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What of her?” interrupted Manfred, eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is at St. Nicholas’s altar,” replied Jerome.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That is no business of Hippolita,” said Manfred with confusion; “let us\n",
      "retire to my chamber, Father, and inform me how she came thither.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, my Lord,” replied the good man, with an air of firmness and\n",
      "authority, that daunted even the resolute Manfred, who could not help\n",
      "revering the saint-like virtues of Jerome; “my commission is to both, and\n",
      "with your Highness’s good-liking, in the presence of both I shall deliver\n",
      "it; but first, my Lord, I must interrogate the Princess, whether she is\n",
      "acquainted with the cause of the Lady Isabella’s retirement from your\n",
      "castle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, on my soul,” said Hippolita; “does Isabella charge me with being\n",
      "privy to it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father,” interrupted Manfred, “I pay due reverence to your holy\n",
      "profession; but I am sovereign here, and will allow no meddling priest to\n",
      "interfere in the affairs of my domestic. If you have aught to say attend\n",
      "me to my chamber; I do not use to let my wife be acquainted with the\n",
      "secret affairs of my state; they are not within a woman’s province.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Lord,” said the holy man, “I am no intruder into the secrets of\n",
      "families. My office is to promote peace, to heal divisions, to preach\n",
      "repentance, and teach mankind to curb their headstrong passions. I\n",
      "forgive your Highness’s uncharitable apostrophe; I know my duty, and am\n",
      "the minister of a mightier prince than Manfred. Hearken to him who\n",
      "speaks through my organs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred trembled with rage and shame. Hippolita’s countenance declared\n",
      "her astonishment and impatience to know where this would end. Her\n",
      "silence more strongly spoke her observance of Manfred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Lady Isabella,” resumed Jerome, “commends herself to both your\n",
      "Highnesses; she thanks both for the kindness with which she has been\n",
      "treated in your castle: she deplores the loss of your son, and her own\n",
      "misfortune in not becoming the daughter of such wise and noble Princes,\n",
      "whom she shall always respect as Parents; she prays for uninterrupted\n",
      "union and felicity between you” [Manfred’s colour changed]: “but as it is\n",
      "no longer possible for her to be allied to you, she entreats your consent\n",
      "to remain in sanctuary, till she can learn news of her father, or, by the\n",
      "certainty of his death, be at liberty, with the approbation of her\n",
      "guardians, to dispose of herself in suitable marriage.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall give no such consent,” said the Prince, “but insist on her\n",
      "return to the castle without delay: I am answerable for her person to her\n",
      "guardians, and will not brook her being in any hands but my own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your Highness will recollect whether that can any longer be proper,”\n",
      "replied the Friar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want no monitor,” said Manfred, colouring; “Isabella’s conduct leaves\n",
      "room for strange suspicions—and that young villain, who was at least the\n",
      "accomplice of her flight, if not the cause of it—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The cause!” interrupted Jerome; “was a _young_ man the cause?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not to be borne!” cried Manfred. “Am I to be bearded in my own\n",
      "palace by an insolent Monk? Thou art privy, I guess, to their amours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would pray to heaven to clear up your uncharitable surmises,” said\n",
      "Jerome, “if your Highness were not satisfied in your conscience how\n",
      "unjustly you accuse me. I do pray to heaven to pardon that\n",
      "uncharitableness: and I implore your Highness to leave the Princess at\n",
      "peace in that holy place, where she is not liable to be disturbed by such\n",
      "vain and worldly fantasies as discourses of love from any man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cant not to me,” said Manfred, “but return and bring the Princess to her\n",
      "duty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is my duty to prevent her return hither,” said Jerome. “She is where\n",
      "orphans and virgins are safest from the snares and wiles of this world;\n",
      "and nothing but a parent’s authority shall take her thence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am her parent,” cried Manfred, “and demand her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She wished to have you for her parent,” said the Friar; “but Heaven that\n",
      "forbad that connection has for ever dissolved all ties betwixt you: and I\n",
      "announce to your Highness—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop! audacious man,” said Manfred, “and dread my displeasure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Holy Father,” said Hippolita, “it is your office to be no respecter of\n",
      "persons: you must speak as your duty prescribes: but it is my duty to\n",
      "hear nothing that it pleases not my Lord I should hear. Attend the\n",
      "Prince to his chamber. I will retire to my oratory, and pray to the\n",
      "blessed Virgin to inspire you with her holy counsels, and to restore the\n",
      "heart of my gracious Lord to its wonted peace and gentleness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excellent woman!” said the Friar. “My Lord, I attend your pleasure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, accompanied by the Friar, passed to his own apartment, where\n",
      "shutting the door, “I perceive, Father,” said he, “that Isabella has\n",
      "acquainted you with my purpose. Now hear my resolve, and obey. Reasons\n",
      "of state, most urgent reasons, my own and the safety of my people, demand\n",
      "that I should have a son. It is in vain to expect an heir from\n",
      "Hippolita. I have made choice of Isabella. You must bring her back; and\n",
      "you must do more. I know the influence you have with Hippolita: her\n",
      "conscience is in your hands. She is, I allow, a faultless woman: her\n",
      "soul is set on heaven, and scorns the little grandeur of this world: you\n",
      "can withdraw her from it entirely. Persuade her to consent to the\n",
      "dissolution of our marriage, and to retire into a monastery—she shall\n",
      "endow one if she will; and she shall have the means of being as liberal\n",
      "to your order as she or you can wish. Thus you will divert the\n",
      "calamities that are hanging over our heads, and have the merit of saving\n",
      "the principality of Otranto from destruction. You are a prudent man, and\n",
      "though the warmth of my temper betrayed me into some unbecoming\n",
      "expressions, I honour your virtue, and wish to be indebted to you for the\n",
      "repose of my life and the preservation of my family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The will of heaven be done!” said the Friar. “I am but its worthless\n",
      "instrument. It makes use of my tongue to tell thee, Prince, of thy\n",
      "unwarrantable designs. The injuries of the virtuous Hippolita have\n",
      "mounted to the throne of pity. By me thou art reprimanded for thy\n",
      "adulterous intention of repudiating her: by me thou art warned not to\n",
      "pursue the incestuous design on thy contracted daughter. Heaven that\n",
      "delivered her from thy fury, when the judgments so recently fallen on thy\n",
      "house ought to have inspired thee with other thoughts, will continue to\n",
      "watch over her. Even I, a poor and despised Friar, am able to protect\n",
      "her from thy violence—I, sinner as I am, and uncharitably reviled by your\n",
      "Highness as an accomplice of I know not what amours, scorn the\n",
      "allurements with which it has pleased thee to tempt mine honesty. I love\n",
      "my order; I honour devout souls; I respect the piety of thy Princess—but\n",
      "I will not betray the confidence she reposes in me, nor serve even the\n",
      "cause of religion by foul and sinful compliances—but forsooth! the\n",
      "welfare of the state depends on your Highness having a son! Heaven mocks\n",
      "the short-sighted views of man. But yester-morn, whose house was so\n",
      "great, so flourishing as Manfred’s?—where is young Conrad now?—My Lord, I\n",
      "respect your tears—but I mean not to check them—let them flow, Prince!\n",
      "They will weigh more with heaven toward the welfare of thy subjects, than\n",
      "a marriage, which, founded on lust or policy, could never prosper. The\n",
      "sceptre, which passed from the race of Alfonso to thine, cannot be\n",
      "preserved by a match which the church will never allow. If it is the\n",
      "will of the Most High that Manfred’s name must perish, resign yourself,\n",
      "my Lord, to its decrees; and thus deserve a crown that can never pass\n",
      "away. Come, my Lord; I like this sorrow—let us return to the Princess:\n",
      "she is not apprised of your cruel intentions; nor did I mean more than to\n",
      "alarm you. You saw with what gentle patience, with what efforts of love,\n",
      "she heard, she rejected hearing, the extent of your guilt. I know she\n",
      "longs to fold you in her arms, and assure you of her unalterable\n",
      "affection.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father,” said the Prince, “you mistake my compunction: true, I honour\n",
      "Hippolita’s virtues; I think her a Saint; and wish it were for my soul’s\n",
      "health to tie faster the knot that has united us—but alas! Father, you\n",
      "know not the bitterest of my pangs! it is some time that I have had\n",
      "scruples on the legality of our union: Hippolita is related to me in the\n",
      "fourth degree—it is true, we had a dispensation: but I have been informed\n",
      "that she had also been contracted to another. This it is that sits heavy\n",
      "at my heart: to this state of unlawful wedlock I impute the visitation\n",
      "that has fallen on me in the death of Conrad!—ease my conscience of this\n",
      "burden: dissolve our marriage, and accomplish the work of godliness—which\n",
      "your divine exhortations have commenced in my soul.”\n",
      "\n",
      "How cutting was the anguish which the good man felt, when he perceived\n",
      "this turn in the wily Prince! He trembled for Hippolita, whose ruin he\n",
      "saw was determined; and he feared if Manfred had no hope of recovering\n",
      "Isabella, that his impatience for a son would direct him to some other\n",
      "object, who might not be equally proof against the temptation of\n",
      "Manfred’s rank. For some time the holy man remained absorbed in thought.\n",
      "At length, conceiving some hopes from delay, he thought the wisest\n",
      "conduct would be to prevent the Prince from despairing of recovering\n",
      "Isabella. Her the Friar knew he could dispose, from her affection to\n",
      "Hippolita, and from the aversion she had expressed to him for Manfred’s\n",
      "addresses, to second his views, till the censures of the church could be\n",
      "fulminated against a divorce. With this intention, as if struck with the\n",

      "truth it is delicacy of conscience that is the real motive of your\n",
      "repugnance to your virtuous Lady, far be it from me to endeavour to\n",
      "harden your heart. The church is an indulgent mother: unfold your griefs\n",
      "to her: she alone can administer comfort to your soul, either by\n",
      "satisfying your conscience, or upon examination of your scruples, by\n",
      "setting you at liberty, and indulging you in the lawful means of\n",
      "continuing your lineage. In the latter case, if the Lady Isabella can be\n",
      "brought to consent—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, who concluded that he had either over-reached the good man, or\n",
      "that his first warmth had been but a tribute paid to appearance, was\n",
      "overjoyed at this sudden turn, and repeated the most magnificent\n",

      "sufficiently reflecting on the impetuosity of Manfred’s temper, conceived\n",
      "that it might not be amiss to sow the seeds of jealousy in his mind: they\n",
      "might be turned to some use hereafter, either by prejudicing the Prince\n",
      "against Isabella, if he persisted in that union or by diverting his\n",
      "attention to a wrong scent, and employing his thoughts on a visionary\n",
      "intrigue, prevent his engaging in any new pursuit. With this unhappy\n",
      "policy, he answered in a manner to confirm Manfred in the belief of some\n",
      "connection between Isabella and the youth. The Prince, whose passions\n",
      "wanted little fuel to throw them into a blaze, fell into a rage at the\n",
      "idea of what the Friar suggested.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue,” cried he; and quitting\n",
      "Jerome abruptly, with a command to remain there till his return, he\n",
      "hastened to the great hall of the castle, and ordered the peasant to be\n",
      "brought before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou hardened young impostor!” said the Prince, as soon as he saw the\n",
      "youth; “what becomes of thy boasted veracity now? it was Providence, was\n",
      "it, and the light of the moon, that discovered the lock of the trap-door\n",
      "to thee? Tell me, audacious boy, who thou art, and how long thou hast\n",
      "been acquainted with the Princess—and take care to answer with less\n",
      "equivocation than thou didst last night, or tortures shall wring the\n",
      "truth from thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man, perceiving that his share in the flight of the Princess\n",
      "was discovered, and concluding that anything he should say could no\n",
      "longer be of any service or detriment to her, replied—\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am no impostor, my Lord, nor have I deserved opprobrious language. I\n",
      "answered to every question your Highness put to me last night with the\n",
      "same veracity that I shall speak now: and that will not be from fear of\n",
      "your tortures, but because my soul abhors a falsehood. Please to repeat\n",
      "your questions, my Lord; I am ready to give you all the satisfaction in\n",
      "my power.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know my questions,” replied the Prince, “and only want time to\n",
      "prepare an evasion. Speak directly; who art thou? and how long hast thou\n",
      "been known to the Princess?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am a labourer at the next village,” said the peasant; “my name is\n",
      "Theodore. The Princess found me in the vault last night: before that\n",
      "hour I never was in her presence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I may believe as much or as little as I please of this,” said Manfred;\n",
      "“but I will hear thy own story before I examine into the truth of it.\n",
      "Tell me, what reason did the Princess give thee for making her escape?\n",
      "thy life depends on thy answer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She told me,” replied Theodore, “that she was on the brink of\n",
      "destruction, and that if she could not escape from the castle, she was in\n",
      "danger in a few moments of being made miserable for ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And on this slight foundation, on a silly girl’s report,” said Manfred,\n",
      "“thou didst hazard my displeasure?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I fear no man’s displeasure,” said Theodore, “when a woman in distress\n",
      "puts herself under my protection.”\n",
      "\n",
      "During this examination, Matilda was going to the apartment of Hippolita.\n",
      "At the upper end of the hall, where Manfred sat, was a boarded gallery\n",
      "with latticed windows, through which Matilda and Bianca were to pass.\n",
      "Hearing her father’s voice, and seeing the servants assembled round him,\n",
      "she stopped to learn the occasion. The prisoner soon drew her attention:\n",
      "the steady and composed manner in which he answered, and the gallantry of\n",
      "his last reply, which were the first words she heard distinctly,\n",
      "interested her in his favour. His person was noble, handsome, and\n",
      "commanding, even in that situation: but his countenance soon engrossed\n",
      "her whole care.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heavens! Bianca,” said the Princess softly, “do I dream? or is not that\n",
      "youth the exact resemblance of Alfonso’s picture in the gallery?”\n",
      "\n",
      "She could say no more, for her father’s voice grew louder at every word.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This bravado,” said he, “surpasses all thy former insolence. Thou shalt\n",
      "experience the wrath with which thou darest to trifle. Seize him,”\n",
      "continued Manfred, “and bind him—the first news the Princess hears of her\n",
      "champion shall be, that he has lost his head for her sake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The injustice of which thou art guilty towards me,” said Theodore,\n",
      "“convinces me that I have done a good deed in delivering the Princess\n",
      "from thy tyranny. May she be happy, whatever becomes of me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is a lover!” cried Manfred in a rage: “a peasant within sight of\n",
      "death is not animated by such sentiments. Tell me, tell me, rash boy,\n",
      "who thou art, or the rack shall force thy secret from thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou hast threatened me with death already,” said the youth, “for the\n",
      "truth I have told thee: if that is all the encouragement I am to expect\n",
      "for sincerity, I am not tempted to indulge thy vain curiosity farther.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then thou wilt not speak?” said Manfred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will not,” replied he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bear him away into the courtyard,” said Manfred; “I will see his head\n",
      "this instant severed from his body.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Matilda fainted at hearing those words. Bianca shrieked, and cried—“Help! help! the Princess is dead!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred started at this ejaculation, and demanded what was the matter!\n",
      "The young peasant, who heard it too, was struck with horror, and asked\n",
      "eagerly the same question; but Manfred ordered him to be hurried into\n",
      "the court, and kept there for execution, till he had informed himself\n",
      "of the cause of Bianca’s shrieks. When he learned the meaning, he\n",
      "treated it as a womanish panic, and ordering Matilda to be carried to\n",
      "her apartment, he rushed into the court, and calling for one of his\n",
      "guards, bade Theodore kneel down, and prepare to receive the fatal blow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The undaunted youth received the bitter sentence with a resignation that\n",
      "touched every heart but Manfred’s. He wished earnestly to know the\n",
      "meaning of the words he had heard relating to the Princess; but fearing\n",
      "to exasperate the tyrant more against her, he desisted. The only boon he\n",
      "deigned to ask was, that he might be permitted to have a confessor, and\n",
      "make his peace with heaven. Manfred, who hoped by the confessor’s means\n",
      "to come at the youth’s history, readily granted his request; and being\n",
      "convinced that Father Jerome was now in his interest, he ordered him to\n",
      "be called and shrive the prisoner. The holy man, who had little foreseen\n",
      "the catastrophe that his imprudence occasioned, fell on his knees to the\n",
      "Prince, and adjured him in the most solemn manner not to shed innocent\n",
      "blood. He accused himself in the bitterest terms for his indiscretion,\n",
      "endeavoured to disculpate the youth, and left no method untried to soften\n",
      "the tyrant’s rage. Manfred, more incensed than appeased by Jerome’s\n",
      "intercession, whose retraction now made him suspect he had been imposed\n",
      "upon by both, commanded the Friar to do his duty, telling him he would\n",
      "not allow the prisoner many minutes for confession.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor do I ask many, my Lord,” said the unhappy young man. “My sins,\n",
      "thank heaven, have not been numerous; nor exceed what might be expected\n",
      "at my years. Dry your tears, good Father, and let us despatch. This is\n",
      "a bad world; nor have I had cause to leave it with regret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh wretched youth!” said Jerome; “how canst thou bear the sight of me\n",
      "with patience? I am thy murderer! it is I have brought this dismal hour\n",
      "upon thee!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forgive thee from my soul,” said the youth, “as I hope heaven will\n",
      "pardon me. Hear my confession, Father; and give me thy blessing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How can I prepare thee for thy passage as I ought?” said Jerome. “Thou\n",
      "canst not be saved without pardoning thy foes—and canst thou forgive that\n",
      "impious man there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can,” said Theodore; “I do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And does not this touch thee, cruel Prince?” said the Friar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sent for thee to confess him,” said Manfred, sternly; “not to plead\n",
      "for him. Thou didst first incense me against him—his blood be upon thy\n",
      "head!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will! it will!” said the good man, in an agony of sorrow. “Thou and\n",
      "I must never hope to go where this blessed youth is going!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Despatch!” said Manfred; “I am no more to be moved by the whining of\n",
      "priests than by the shrieks of women.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” said the youth; “is it possible that my fate could have\n",
      "occasioned what I heard! Is the Princess then again in thy power?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou dost but remember me of my wrath,” said Manfred. “Prepare thee,\n",
      "for this moment is thy last.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The youth, who felt his indignation rise, and who was touched with the\n",
      "sorrow which he saw he had infused into all the spectators, as well as\n",
      "into the Friar, suppressed his emotions, and putting off his doublet, and\n",
      "unbuttoning his collar, knelt down to his prayers. As he stooped, his\n",
      "shirt slipped down below his shoulder, and discovered the mark of a\n",
      "bloody arrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gracious heaven!” cried the holy man, starting; “what do I see? It is\n",
      "my child! my Theodore!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The passions that ensued must be conceived; they cannot be painted. The\n",
      "tears of the assistants were suspended by wonder, rather than stopped by\n",
      "joy. They seemed to inquire in the eyes of their Lord what they ought to\n",
      "feel. Surprise, doubt, tenderness, respect, succeeded each other in the\n",
      "countenance of the youth. He received with modest submission the\n",
      "effusion of the old man’s tears and embraces. Yet afraid of giving a\n",
      "loose to hope, and suspecting from what had passed the inflexibility of\n",
      "Manfred’s temper, he cast a glance towards the Prince, as if to say,\n",
      "canst thou be unmoved at such a scene as this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred’s heart was capable of being touched. He forgot his anger in his\n",
      "astonishment; yet his pride forbad his owning himself affected. He even\n",
      "doubted whether this discovery was not a contrivance of the Friar to save\n",
      "the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What may this mean?” said he. “How can he be thy son? Is it consistent\n",
      "with thy profession or reputed sanctity to avow a peasant’s offspring for\n",
      "the fruit of thy irregular amours!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, God!” said the holy man, “dost thou question his being mine? Could\n",
      "I feel the anguish I do if I were not his father? Spare him! good\n",
      "Prince! spare him! and revile me as thou pleasest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Spare him! spare him!” cried the attendants; “for this good man’s sake!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peace!” said Manfred, sternly. “I must know more ere I am disposed to\n",
      "pardon. A Saint’s bastard may be no saint himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Injurious Lord!” said Theodore, “add not insult to cruelty. If I am\n",
      "this venerable man’s son, though no Prince, as thou art, know the blood\n",
      "that flows in my veins—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said the Friar, interrupting him, “his blood is noble; nor is he\n",
      "that abject thing, my Lord, you speak him. He is my lawful son, and\n",
      "Sicily can boast of few houses more ancient than that of Falconara. But\n",
      "alas! my Lord, what is blood! what is nobility! We are all reptiles,\n",
      "miserable, sinful creatures. It is piety alone that can distinguish us\n",
      "from the dust whence we sprung, and whither we must return.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Truce to your sermon,” said Manfred; “you forget you are no longer Friar\n",
      "Jerome, but the Count of Falconara. Let me know your history; you will\n",
      "have time to moralise hereafter, if you should not happen to obtain the\n",
      "grace of that sturdy criminal there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mother of God!” said the Friar, “is it possible my Lord can refuse a\n",
      "father the life of his only, his long-lost, child! Trample me, my Lord,\n",
      "scorn, afflict me, accept my life for his, but spare my son!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou canst feel, then,” said Manfred, “what it is to lose an only son!\n",
      "A little hour ago thou didst preach up resignation to me: _my_ house, if\n",
      "fate so pleased, must perish—but the Count of Falconara—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas! my Lord,” said Jerome, “I confess I have offended; but aggravate\n",
      "not an old man’s sufferings! I boast not of my family, nor think of such\n",
      "vanities—it is nature, that pleads for this boy; it is the memory of the\n",
      "dear woman that bore him. Is she, Theodore, is she dead?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her soul has long been with the blessed,” said Theodore.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! how?” cried Jerome, “tell me—no—she is happy! Thou art all my care\n",
      "now!—Most dread Lord! will you—will you grant me my poor boy’s life?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Return to thy convent,” answered Manfred; “conduct the Princess hither;\n",
      "obey me in what else thou knowest; and I promise thee the life of thy\n",
      "son.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! my Lord,” said Jerome, “is my honesty the price I must pay for this\n",
      "dear youth’s safety?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“For me!” cried Theodore. “Let me die a thousand deaths, rather than\n",
      "stain thy conscience. What is it the tyrant would exact of thee? Is the\n",
      "Princess still safe from his power? Protect her, thou venerable old man;\n",
      "and let all the weight of his wrath fall on me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerome endeavoured to check the impetuosity of the youth; and ere Manfred\n",
      "could reply, the trampling of horses was heard, and a brazen trumpet,\n",
      "which hung without the gate of the castle, was suddenly sounded. At the\n",
      "same instant the sable plumes on the enchanted helmet, which still\n",
      "remained at the other end of the court, were tempestuously agitated, and\n",
      "nodded thrice, as if bowed by some invisible wearer.\n",

      "CHAPTER III.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred’s heart misgave him when he beheld the plumage on the miraculous\n",
      "casque shaken in concert with the sounding of the brazen trumpet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Father!” said he to Jerome, whom he now ceased to treat as Count of\n",
      "Falconara, “what mean these portents? If I have offended—” the plumes\n",
      "were shaken with greater violence than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Unhappy Prince that I am,” cried Manfred. “Holy Father! will you not\n",
      "assist me with your prayers?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Lord,” replied Jerome, “heaven is no doubt displeased with your\n",
      "mockery of its servants. Submit yourself to the church; and cease to\n",
      "persecute her ministers. Dismiss this innocent youth; and learn to\n",
      "respect the holy character I wear. Heaven will not be trifled with: you\n",
      "see—” the trumpet sounded again.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I acknowledge I have been too hasty,” said Manfred. “Father, do you go\n",
      "to the wicket, and demand who is at the gate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you grant me the life of Theodore?” replied the Friar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do,” said Manfred; “but inquire who is without!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerome, falling on the neck of his son, discharged a flood of tears, that\n",
      "spoke the fulness of his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You promised to go to the gate,” said Manfred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought,” replied the Friar, “your Highness would excuse my thanking\n",
      "you first in this tribute of my heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go, dearest Sir,” said Theodore; “obey the Prince. I do not deserve\n",
      "that you should delay his satisfaction for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerome, inquiring who was without, was answered, “A Herald.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“From whom?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From the Knight of the Gigantic Sabre,” said the Herald; “and I must\n",
      "speak with the usurper of Otranto.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerome returned to the Prince, and did not fail to repeat the message in\n",
      "the very words it had been uttered. The first sounds struck Manfred with\n",
      "terror; but when he heard himself styled usurper, his rage rekindled, and\n",
      "all his courage revived.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Usurper!—insolent villain!” cried he; “who dares to question my title?\n",
      "Retire, Father; this is no business for Monks: I will meet this\n",
      "presumptuous man myself. Go to your convent and prepare the Princess’s\n",
      "return. Your son shall be a hostage for your fidelity: his life depends\n",
      "on your obedience.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good heaven! my Lord,” cried Jerome, “your Highness did but this instant\n",
      "freely pardon my child—have you so soon forgot the interposition of\n",
      "heaven?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heaven,” replied Manfred, “does not send Heralds to question the title\n",
      "of a lawful Prince. I doubt whether it even notifies its will through\n",
      "Friars—but that is your affair, not mine. At present you know my\n",
      "pleasure; and it is not a saucy Herald that shall save your son, if you\n",
      "do not return with the Princess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in vain for the holy man to reply. Manfred commanded him to be\n",
      "conducted to the postern-gate, and shut out from the castle. And he\n",
      "ordered some of his attendants to carry Theodore to the top of the black\n",
      "tower, and guard him strictly; scarce permitting the father and son to\n",
      "exchange a hasty embrace at parting. He then withdrew to the hall, and\n",
      "seating himself in princely state, ordered the Herald to be admitted to\n",
      "his presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well! thou insolent!” said the Prince, “what wouldst thou with me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I come,” replied he, “to thee, Manfred, usurper of the principality of\n",
      "Otranto, from the renowned and invincible Knight, the Knight of the\n",
      "Gigantic Sabre: in the name of his Lord, Frederic, Marquis of Vicenza, he\n",
      "demands the Lady Isabella, daughter of that Prince, whom thou hast basely\n",
      "and traitorously got into thy power, by bribing her false guardians\n",
      "during his absence; and he requires thee to resign the principality of\n",
      "Otranto, which thou hast usurped from the said Lord Frederic, the nearest\n",
      "of blood to the last rightful Lord, Alfonso the Good. If thou dost not\n",
      "instantly comply with these just demands, he defies thee to single combat\n",
      "to the last extremity.” And so saying the Herald cast down his warder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And where is this braggart who sends thee?” said Manfred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At the distance of a league,” said the Herald: “he comes to make good\n",
      "his Lord’s claim against thee, as he is a true knight, and thou an\n",
      "usurper and ravisher.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Injurious as this challenge was, Manfred reflected that it was not his\n",
      "interest to provoke the Marquis. He knew how well founded the claim of\n",
      "Frederic was; nor was this the first time he had heard of it. Frederic’s\n",
      "ancestors had assumed the style of Princes of Otranto, from the death of\n",
      "Alfonso the Good without issue; but Manfred, his father, and grandfather,\n",
      "had been too powerful for the house of Vicenza to dispossess them.\n",
      "Frederic, a martial and amorous young Prince, had married a beautiful\n",
      "young lady, of whom he was enamoured, and who had died in childbed of\n",
      "Isabella. Her death affected him so much that he had taken the cross and\n",
      "gone to the Holy Land, where he was wounded in an engagement against the\n",
      "infidels, made prisoner, and reported to be dead. When the news reached\n",
      "Manfred’s ears, he bribed the guardians of the Lady Isabella to deliver\n",
      "her up to him as a bride for his son Conrad, by which alliance he had\n",
      "proposed to unite the claims of the two houses. This motive, on Conrad’s\n",
      "death, had co-operated to make him so suddenly resolve on espousing her\n",
      "himself; and the same reflection determined him now to endeavour at\n",
      "obtaining the consent of Frederic to this marriage. A like policy\n",
      "inspired him with the thought of inviting Frederic’s champion into the\n",
      "castle, lest he should be informed of Isabella’s flight, which he\n",
      "strictly enjoined his domestics not to disclose to any of the Knight’s\n",
      "retinue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Herald,” said Manfred, as soon as he had digested these reflections,\n",
      "“return to thy master, and tell him, ere we liquidate our differences by\n",
      "the sword, Manfred would hold some converse with him. Bid him welcome to\n",
      "my castle, where by my faith, as I am a true Knight, he shall have\n",
      "courteous reception, and full security for himself and followers. If we\n",
      "cannot adjust our quarrel by amicable means, I swear he shall depart in\n",
      "safety, and shall have full satisfaction according to the laws of arms:\n",
      "So help me God and His holy Trinity!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Herald made three obeisances and retired.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this interview Jerome’s mind was agitated by a thousand contrary\n",
      "passions. He trembled for the life of his son, and his first thought was\n",
      "to persuade Isabella to return to the castle. Yet he was scarce less\n",
      "alarmed at the thought of her union with Manfred. He dreaded Hippolita’s\n",
      "unbounded submission to the will of her Lord; and though he did not doubt\n",
      "but he could alarm her piety not to consent to a divorce, if he could get\n",
      "access to her; yet should Manfred discover that the obstruction came from\n",
      "him, it might be equally fatal to Theodore. He was impatient to know\n",
      "whence came the Herald, who with so little management had questioned the\n",
      "title of Manfred: yet he did not dare absent himself from the convent,\n",
      "lest Isabella should leave it, and her flight be imputed to him. He\n",
      "returned disconsolately to the monastery, uncertain on what conduct to\n",
      "resolve. A Monk, who met him in the porch and observed his melancholy\n",
      "air, said—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas! brother, is it then true that we have lost our excellent Princess\n",
      "Hippolita?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The holy man started, and cried, “What meanest thou, brother? I come\n",
      "this instant from the castle, and left her in perfect health.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Martelli,” replied the other Friar, “passed by the convent but a quarter\n",
      "of an hour ago on his way from the castle, and reported that her Highness\n",
      "was dead. All our brethren are gone to the chapel to pray for her happy\n",
      "transit to a better life, and willed me to wait thy arrival. They know\n",
      "thy holy attachment to that good Lady, and are anxious for the affliction\n",
      "it will cause in thee—indeed we have all reason to weep; she was a mother\n",
      "to our house. But this life is but a pilgrimage; we must not murmur—we\n",
      "shall all follow her! May our end be like hers!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good brother, thou dreamest,” said Jerome. “I tell thee I come from the\n",
      "castle, and left the Princess well. Where is the Lady Isabella?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Poor Gentlewoman!” replied the Friar; “I told her the sad news, and\n",
      "offered her spiritual comfort. I reminded her of the transitory\n",
      "condition of mortality, and advised her to take the veil: I quoted the\n",
      "example of the holy Princess Sanchia of Arragon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thy zeal was laudable,” said Jerome, impatiently; “but at present it was\n",
      "unnecessary: Hippolita is well—at least I trust in the Lord she is; I\n",
      "heard nothing to the contrary—yet, methinks, the Prince’s\n",
      "earnestness—Well, brother, but where is the Lady Isabella?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know not,” said the Friar; “she wept much, and said she would retire\n",
      "to her chamber.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerome left his comrade abruptly, and hastened to the Princess, but she\n",
      "was not in her chamber. He inquired of the domestics of the convent, but\n",
      "could learn no news of her. He searched in vain throughout the monastery\n",
      "and the church, and despatched messengers round the neighbourhood, to get\n",
      "intelligence if she had been seen; but to no purpose. Nothing could\n",
      "equal the good man’s perplexity. He judged that Isabella, suspecting\n",
      "Manfred of having precipitated his wife’s death, had taken the alarm, and\n",
      "withdrawn herself to some more secret place of concealment. This new\n",
      "flight would probably carry the Prince’s fury to the height. The report\n",
      "of Hippolita’s death, though it seemed almost incredible, increased his\n",
      "consternation; and though Isabella’s escape bespoke her aversion of\n",
      "Manfred for a husband, Jerome could feel no comfort from it, while it\n",
      "endangered the life of his son. He determined to return to the castle,\n",
      "and made several of his brethren accompany him to attest his innocence to\n",
      "Manfred, and, if necessary, join their intercession with his for\n",
      "Theodore.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince, in the meantime, had passed into the court, and ordered the\n",
      "gates of the castle to be flung open for the reception of the stranger\n",
      "Knight and his train. In a few minutes the cavalcade arrived. First\n",
      "came two harbingers with wands. Next a herald, followed by two pages and\n",
      "two trumpets. Then a hundred foot-guards. These were attended by as\n",
      "many horse. After them fifty footmen, clothed in scarlet and black, the\n",
      "colours of the Knight. Then a led horse. Two heralds on each side of a\n",
      "gentleman on horseback bearing a banner with the arms of Vicenza and\n",
      "Otranto quarterly—a circumstance that much offended Manfred—but he\n",
      "stifled his resentment. Two more pages. The Knight’s confessor telling\n",
      "his beads. Fifty more footmen clad as before. Two Knights habited in\n",
      "complete armour, their beavers down, comrades to the principal Knight.\n",
      "The squires of the two Knights, carrying their shields and devices. The\n",
      "Knight’s own squire. A hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous sword, and\n",
      "seeming to faint under the weight of it. The Knight himself on a\n",
      "chestnut steed, in complete armour, his lance in the rest, his face\n",
      "entirely concealed by his vizor, which was surmounted by a large plume of\n",
      "scarlet and black feathers. Fifty foot-guards with drums and trumpets\n",
      "closed the procession, which wheeled off to the right and left to make\n",
      "room for the principal Knight.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he approached the gate he stopped; and the herald advancing,\n",
      "read again the words of the challenge. Manfred’s eyes were fixed on the\n",
      "gigantic sword, and he scarce seemed to attend to the cartel: but his\n",
      "attention was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that rose behind him.\n",
      "He turned and beheld the Plumes of the enchanted helmet agitated in the\n",
      "same extraordinary manner as before. It required intrepidity like\n",
      "Manfred’s not to sink under a concurrence of circumstances that seemed to\n",
      "announce his fate. Yet scorning in the presence of strangers to betray\n",
      "the courage he had always manifested, he said boldly—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir Knight, whoever thou art, I bid thee welcome. If thou art of mortal\n",
      "mould, thy valour shall meet its equal: and if thou art a true Knight,\n",
      "thou wilt scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy point. Be these omens\n",
      "from heaven or hell, Manfred trusts to the righteousness of his cause and\n",
      "to the aid of St. Nicholas, who has ever protected his house. Alight,\n",
      "Sir Knight, and repose thyself. To-morrow thou shalt have a fair field,\n",
      "and heaven befriend the juster side!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knight made no reply, but dismounting, was conducted by Manfred to\n",
      "the great hall of the castle. As they traversed the court, the Knight\n",
      "stopped to gaze on the miraculous casque; and kneeling down, seemed to\n",
      "pray inwardly for some minutes. Rising, he made a sign to the Prince to\n",
      "lead on. As soon as they entered the hall, Manfred proposed to the\n",
      "stranger to disarm, but the Knight shook his head in token of refusal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir Knight,” said Manfred, “this is not courteous, but by my good faith\n",
      "I will not cross thee, nor shalt thou have cause to complain of the\n",
      "Prince of Otranto. No treachery is designed on my part; I hope none is\n",
      "intended on thine; here take my gage” (giving him his ring): “your\n",
      "friends and you shall enjoy the laws of hospitality. Rest here until\n",
      "refreshments are brought. I will but give orders for the accommodation\n",
      "of your train, and return to you.” The three Knights bowed as accepting\n",
      "his courtesy. Manfred directed the stranger’s retinue to be conducted to\n",
      "an adjacent hospital, founded by the Princess Hippolita for the reception\n",
      "of pilgrims. As they made the circuit of the court to return towards the\n",
      "gate, the gigantic sword burst from the supporters, and falling to the\n",
      "ground opposite to the helmet, remained immovable. Manfred, almost\n",
      "hardened to preternatural appearances, surmounted the shock of this new\n",
      "prodigy; and returning to the hall, where by this time the feast was\n",
      "ready, he invited his silent guests to take their places. Manfred,\n",
      "however ill his heart was at ease, endeavoured to inspire the company\n",
      "with mirth. He put several questions to them, but was answered only by\n",
      "signs. They raised their vizors but sufficiently to feed themselves, and\n",
      "that sparingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sirs” said the Prince, “ye are the first guests I ever treated within\n",
      "these walls who scorned to hold any intercourse with me: nor has it oft\n",
      "been customary, I ween, for princes to hazard their state and dignity\n",
      "against strangers and mutes. You say you come in the name of Frederic of\n",
      "Vicenza; I have ever heard that he was a gallant and courteous Knight;\n",
      "nor would he, I am bold to say, think it beneath him to mix in social\n",
      "converse with a Prince that is his equal, and not unknown by deeds in\n",
      "arms. Still ye are silent—well! be it as it may—by the laws of\n",
      "hospitality and chivalry ye are masters under this roof: ye shall do your\n",
      "pleasure. But come, give me a goblet of wine; ye will not refuse to\n",
      "pledge me to the healths of your fair mistresses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The principal Knight sighed and crossed himself, and was rising from the\n",
      "board.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir Knight,” said Manfred, “what I said was but in sport. I shall\n",
      "constrain you in nothing: use your good liking. Since mirth is not your\n",
      "mood, let us be sad. Business may hit your fancies better. Let us\n",
      "withdraw, and hear if what I have to unfold may be better relished than\n",
      "the vain efforts I have made for your pastime.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred then conducting the three Knights into an inner chamber, shut the\n",
      "door, and inviting them to be seated, began thus, addressing himself to\n",
      "the chief personage:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“You come, Sir Knight, as I understand, in the name of the Marquis of\n",
      "Vicenza, to re-demand the Lady Isabella, his daughter, who has been\n",
      "contracted in the face of Holy Church to my son, by the consent of her\n",
      "legal guardians; and to require me to resign my dominions to your Lord,\n",
      "who gives himself for the nearest of blood to Prince Alfonso, whose soul\n",
      "God rest! I shall speak to the latter article of your demands first.\n",
      "You must know, your Lord knows, that I enjoy the principality of Otranto\n",
      "from my father, Don Manuel, as he received it from his father, Don\n",
      "Ricardo. Alfonso, their predecessor, dying childless in the Holy Land,\n",
      "bequeathed his estates to my grandfather, Don Ricardo, in consideration\n",
      "of his faithful services.” The stranger shook his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir Knight,” said Manfred, warmly, “Ricardo was a valiant and upright\n",
      "man; he was a pious man; witness his munificent foundation of the\n",
      "adjoining church and two convents. He was peculiarly patronised by St.\n",
      "Nicholas—my grandfather was incapable—I say, Sir, Don Ricardo was\n",
      "incapable—excuse me, your interruption has disordered me. I venerate the\n",
      "memory of my grandfather. Well, Sirs, he held this estate; he held it by\n",
      "his good sword and by the favour of St. Nicholas—so did my father; and\n",
      "so, Sirs, will I, come what come will. But Frederic, your Lord, is\n",
      "nearest in blood. I have consented to put my title to the issue of the\n",
      "sword. Does that imply a vicious title? I might have asked, where is\n",
      "Frederic your Lord? Report speaks him dead in captivity. You say, your\n",
      "actions say, he lives—I question it not—I might, Sirs, I might—but I do\n",
      "not. Other Princes would bid Frederic take his inheritance by force, if\n",
      "he can: they would not stake their dignity on a single combat: they would\n",
      "not submit it to the decision of unknown mutes!—pardon me, gentlemen, I\n",
      "am too warm: but suppose yourselves in my situation: as ye are stout\n",
      "Knights, would it not move your choler to have your own and the honour of\n",
      "your ancestors called in question?” “But to the point. Ye require me to\n",
      "deliver up the Lady Isabella. Sirs, I must ask if ye are authorised to\n",
      "receive her?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knight nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Receive her,” continued Manfred; “well, you are authorised to receive\n",
      "her, but, gentle Knight, may I ask if you have full powers?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knight nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“’Tis well,” said Manfred; “then hear what I have to offer. Ye see,\n",
      "gentlemen, before you, the most unhappy of men!” (he began to weep);\n",
      "“afford me your compassion; I am entitled to it, indeed I am. Know, I\n",
      "have lost my only hope, my joy, the support of my house—Conrad died\n",
      "yester morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knights discovered signs of surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Sirs, fate has disposed of my son. Isabella is at liberty.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you then restore her?” cried the chief Knight, breaking silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Afford me your patience,” said Manfred. “I rejoice to find, by this\n",
      "testimony of your goodwill, that this matter may be adjusted without\n",
      "blood. It is no interest of mine dictates what little I have farther to\n",
      "say. Ye behold in me a man disgusted with the world: the loss of my son\n",
      "has weaned me from earthly cares. Power and greatness have no longer any\n",
      "charms in my eyes. I wished to transmit the sceptre I had received from\n",
      "my ancestors with honour to my son—but that is over! Life itself is so\n",
      "indifferent to me, that I accepted your defiance with joy. A good Knight\n",
      "cannot go to the grave with more satisfaction than when falling in his\n",
      "vocation: whatever is the will of heaven, I submit; for alas! Sirs, I am\n",
      "a man of many sorrows. Manfred is no object of envy, but no doubt you\n",
      "are acquainted with my story.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knight made signs of ignorance, and seemed curious to have Manfred\n",
      "proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it possible, Sirs,” continued the Prince, “that my story should be a\n",
      "secret to you? Have you heard nothing relating to me and the Princess\n",
      "Hippolita?”\n",
      "\n",
      "They shook their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No! Thus, then, Sirs, it is. You think me ambitious: ambition, alas!\n",
      "is composed of more rugged materials. If I were ambitious, I should not\n",
      "for so many years have been a prey to all the hell of conscientious\n",
      "scruples. But I weary your patience: I will be brief. Know, then, that\n",
      "I have long been troubled in mind on my union with the Princess\n",
      "Hippolita. Oh! Sirs, if ye were acquainted with that excellent woman! if\n",
      "ye knew that I adore her like a mistress, and cherish her as a friend—but\n",
      "man was not born for perfect happiness! She shares my scruples, and with\n",
      "her consent I have brought this matter before the church, for we are\n",
      "related within the forbidden degrees. I expect every hour the definitive\n",
      "sentence that must separate us for ever—I am sure you feel for me—I see\n",
      "you do—pardon these tears!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knights gazed on each other, wondering where this would end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred continued—\n",
      "\n",
      "“The death of my son betiding while my soul was under this anxiety, I\n",
      "thought of nothing but resigning my dominions, and retiring for ever from\n",
      "the sight of mankind. My only difficulty was to fix on a successor, who\n",
      "would be tender of my people, and to dispose of the Lady Isabella, who is\n",
      "dear to me as my own blood. I was willing to restore the line of\n",
      "Alfonso, even in his most distant kindred. And though, pardon me, I am\n",
      "satisfied it was his will that Ricardo’s lineage should take place of his\n",
      "own relations; yet where was I to search for those relations? I knew of\n",
      "none but Frederic, your Lord; he was a captive to the infidels, or dead;\n",
      "and were he living, and at home, would he quit the flourishing State of\n",
      "Vicenza for the inconsiderable principality of Otranto? If he would not,\n",
      "could I bear the thought of seeing a hard, unfeeling, Viceroy set over my\n",
      "poor faithful people? for, Sirs, I love my people, and thank heaven am\n",
      "beloved by them. But ye will ask whither tends this long discourse?\n",
      "Briefly, then, thus, Sirs. Heaven in your arrival seems to point out a\n",
      "remedy for these difficulties and my misfortunes. The Lady Isabella is\n",
      "at liberty; I shall soon be so. I would submit to anything for the good\n",
      "of my people. Were it not the best, the only way to extinguish the feuds\n",
      "between our families, if I was to take the Lady Isabella to wife? You\n",
      "start. But though Hippolita’s virtues will ever be dear to me, a Prince\n",
      "must not consider himself; he is born for his people.” A servant at that\n",
      "instant entering the chamber apprised Manfred that Jerome and several of\n",
      "his brethren demanded immediate access to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince, provoked at this interruption, and fearing that the Friar\n",
      "would discover to the strangers that Isabella had taken sanctuary, was\n",
      "going to forbid Jerome’s entrance. But recollecting that he was\n",
      "certainly arrived to notify the Princess’s return, Manfred began to\n",
      "excuse himself to the Knights for leaving them for a few moments, but was\n",
      "prevented by the arrival of the Friars. Manfred angrily reprimanded them\n",
      "for their intrusion, and would have forced them back from the chamber;\n",
      "but Jerome was too much agitated to be repulsed. He declared aloud the\n",
      "flight of Isabella, with protestations of his own innocence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, distracted at the news, and not less at its coming to the\n",
      "knowledge of the strangers, uttered nothing but incoherent sentences, now\n",
      "upbraiding the Friar, now apologising to the Knights, earnest to know\n",
      "what was become of Isabella, yet equally afraid of their knowing;\n",
      "impatient to pursue her, yet dreading to have them join in the pursuit.\n",
      "He offered to despatch messengers in quest of her, but the chief Knight,\n",
      "no longer keeping silence, reproached Manfred in bitter terms for his\n",
      "dark and ambiguous dealing, and demanded the cause of Isabella’s first\n",
      "absence from the castle. Manfred, casting a stern look at Jerome,\n",
      "implying a command of silence, pretended that on Conrad’s death he had\n",
      "placed her in sanctuary until he could determine how to dispose of her.\n",
      "Jerome, who trembled for his son’s life, did not dare contradict this\n",
      "falsehood, but one of his brethren, not under the same anxiety, declared\n",
      "frankly that she had fled to their church in the preceding night. The\n",
      "Prince in vain endeavoured to stop this discovery, which overwhelmed him\n",
      "with shame and confusion. The principal stranger, amazed at the\n",
      "contradictions he heard, and more than half persuaded that Manfred had\n",
      "secreted the Princess, notwithstanding the concern he expressed at her\n",
      "flight, rushing to the door, said—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou traitor Prince! Isabella shall be found.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred endeavoured to hold him, but the other Knights assisting their\n",
      "comrade, he broke from the Prince, and hastened into the court, demanding\n",
      "his attendants. Manfred, finding it vain to divert him from the pursuit,\n",
      "offered to accompany him and summoning his attendants, and taking Jerome\n",
      "and some of the Friars to guide them, they issued from the castle;\n",
      "Manfred privately giving orders to have the Knight’s company secured,\n",
      "while to the knight he affected to despatch a messenger to require their\n",
      "assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company had no sooner quitted the castle than Matilda, who felt\n",
      "herself deeply interested for the young peasant, since she had seen him\n",
      "condemned to death in the hall, and whose thoughts had been taken up with\n",
      "concerting measures to save him, was informed by some of the female\n",
      "attendants that Manfred had despatched all his men various ways in\n",
      "pursuit of Isabella. He had in his hurry given this order in general\n",
      "terms, not meaning to extend it to the guard he had set upon Theodore,\n",
      "but forgetting it. The domestics, officious to obey so peremptory a\n",
      "Prince, and urged by their own curiosity and love of novelty to join in\n",
      "any precipitate chase, had to a man left the castle. Matilda disengaged\n",
      "herself from her women, stole up to the black tower, and unbolting the\n",
      "door, presented herself to the astonished Theodore.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Young man,” said she, “though filial duty and womanly modesty condemn\n",
      "the step I am taking, yet holy charity, surmounting all other ties,\n",
      "justifies this act. Fly; the doors of thy prison are open: my father and\n",
      "his domestics are absent; but they may soon return. Be gone in safety;\n",
      "and may the angels of heaven direct thy course!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art surely one of those angels!” said the enraptured Theodore:\n",
      "“none but a blessed saint could speak, could act—could look—like thee.\n",
      "May I not know the name of my divine protectress? Methought thou namedst\n",
      "thy father. Is it possible? Can Manfred’s blood feel holy pity! Lovely\n",
      "Lady, thou answerest not. But how art thou here thyself? Why dost thou\n",
      "neglect thy own safety, and waste a thought on a wretch like Theodore?\n",
      "Let us fly together: the life thou bestowest shall be dedicated to thy\n",
      "defence.”\n",

      "till thou canst make signs to some vessel to put on shore, and take thee\n",

      "himself eternally her knight. Ere the Princess could reply, a clap of\n",
      "thunder was suddenly heard that shook the battlements. Theodore,\n",
      "regardless of the tempest, would have urged his suit: but the Princess,\n",
      "dismayed, retreated hastily into the castle, and commanded the youth to\n",
      "be gone with an air that would not be disobeyed. He sighed, and retired,\n",
      "but with eyes fixed on the gate, until Matilda, closing it, put an end to\n",

      "passion, which both now tasted for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theodore went pensively to the convent, to acquaint his father with his\n",
      "deliverance. There he learned the absence of Jerome, and the pursuit\n",
      "that was making after the Lady Isabella, with some particulars of whose\n",
      "story he now first became acquainted. The generous gallantry of his\n",
      "nature prompted him to wish to assist her; but the Monks could lend him\n",
      "no lights to guess at the route she had taken. He was not tempted to\n",
      "wander far in search of her, for the idea of Matilda had imprinted itself\n",
      "so strongly on his heart, that he could not bear to absent himself at\n",
      "much distance from her abode. The tenderness Jerome had expressed for\n",
      "him concurred to confirm this reluctance; and he even persuaded himself\n",
      "that filial affection was the chief cause of his hovering between the\n",
      "castle and monastery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until Jerome should return at night, Theodore at length determined to\n",
      "repair to the forest that Matilda had pointed out to him. Arriving\n",
      "there, he sought the gloomiest shades, as best suited to the pleasing\n",
      "melancholy that reigned in his mind. In this mood he roved insensibly to\n",
      "the caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits, and were now\n",
      "reported round the country to be haunted by evil spirits. He recollected\n",
      "to have heard this tradition; and being of a brave and adventurous\n",
      "disposition, he willingly indulged his curiosity in exploring the secret\n",
      "recesses of this labyrinth. He had not penetrated far before he thought\n",
      "he heard the steps of some person who seemed to retreat before him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theodore, though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be\n",
      "believed, had no apprehension that good men were abandoned without cause\n",
      "to the malice of the powers of darkness. He thought the place more\n",
      "likely to be infested by robbers than by those infernal agents who are\n",
      "reported to molest and bewilder travellers. He had long burned with\n",
      "impatience to approve his valour. Drawing his sabre, he marched sedately\n",
      "onwards, still directing his steps as the imperfect rustling sound before\n",
      "him led the way. The armour he wore was a like indication to the person\n",
      "who avoided him. Theodore, now convinced that he was not mistaken,\n",
      "redoubled his pace, and evidently gained on the person that fled, whose\n",
      "haste increasing, Theodore came up just as a woman fell breathless before\n",
      "him. He hasted to raise her, but her terror was so great that he\n",
      "apprehended she would faint in his arms. He used every gentle word to\n",
      "dispel her alarms, and assured her that far from injuring, he would\n",
      "defend her at the peril of his life. The Lady recovering her spirits\n",
      "from his courteous demeanour, and gazing on her protector, said—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure, I have heard that voice before!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not to my knowledge,” replied Theodore; “unless, as I conjecture, thou\n",
      "art the Lady Isabella.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Merciful heaven!” cried she. “Thou art not sent in quest of me, art\n",
      "thou?” And saying those words, she threw herself at his feet, and\n",
      "besought him not to deliver her up to Manfred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To Manfred!” cried Theodore—“no, Lady; I have once already delivered\n",
      "thee from his tyranny, and it shall fare hard with me now, but I will\n",
      "place thee out of the reach of his daring.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it possible,” said she, “that thou shouldst be the generous unknown\n",
      "whom I met last night in the vault of the castle? Sure thou art not a\n",
      "mortal, but my guardian angel. On my knees, let me thank—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold! gentle Princess,” said Theodore, “nor demean thyself before a poor\n",
      "and friendless young man. If heaven has selected me for thy deliverer,\n",
      "it will accomplish its work, and strengthen my arm in thy cause. But\n",
      "come, Lady, we are too near the mouth of the cavern; let us seek its\n",
      "inmost recesses. I can have no tranquillity till I have placed thee\n",
      "beyond the reach of danger.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas! what mean you, sir?” said she. “Though all your actions are\n",
      "noble, though your sentiments speak the purity of your soul, is it\n",
      "fitting that I should accompany you alone into these perplexed retreats?\n",
      "Should we be found together, what would a censorious world think of my\n",
      "conduct?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I respect your virtuous delicacy,” said Theodore; “nor do you harbour a\n",
      "suspicion that wounds my honour. I meant to conduct you into the most\n",
      "private cavity of these rocks, and then at the hazard of my life to guard\n",
      "their entrance against every living thing. Besides, Lady,” continued he,\n",
      "drawing a deep sigh, “beauteous and all perfect as your form is, and\n",
      "though my wishes are not guiltless of aspiring, know, my soul is\n",
      "dedicated to another; and although—” A sudden noise prevented Theodore\n",
      "from proceeding. They soon distinguished these sounds—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isabella! what, ho! Isabella!” The trembling Princess relapsed into her\n",
      "former agony of fear. Theodore endeavoured to encourage her, but in\n",
      "vain. He assured her he would die rather than suffer her to return under\n",
      "Manfred’s power; and begging her to remain concealed, he went forth to\n",
      "prevent the person in search of her from approaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the mouth of the cavern he found an armed Knight, discoursing with a\n",
      "peasant, who assured him he had seen a lady enter the passes of the rock.\n",
      "The Knight was preparing to seek her, when Theodore, placing himself in\n",
      "his way, with his sword drawn, sternly forbad him at his peril to\n",
      "advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And who art thou, who darest to cross my way?” said the Knight,\n",
      "haughtily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One who does not dare more than he will perform,” said Theodore.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I seek the Lady Isabella,” said the Knight, “and understand she has\n",
      "taken refuge among these rocks. Impede me not, or thou wilt repent\n",
      "having provoked my resentment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thy purpose is as odious as thy resentment is contemptible,” said\n",

      "resentment is most terrible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger, who was the principal Knight that had arrived from the\n",
      "Marquis of Vicenza, had galloped from Manfred as he was busied in getting\n",
      "information of the Princess, and giving various orders to prevent her\n",
      "falling into the power of the three Knights. Their chief had suspected\n",
      "Manfred of being privy to the Princess’s absconding, and this insult from\n",
      "a man, who he concluded was stationed by that Prince to secrete her,\n",
      "confirming his suspicions, he made no reply, but discharging a blow with\n",
      "his sabre at Theodore, would soon have removed all obstruction, if\n",
      "Theodore, who took him for one of Manfred’s captains, and who had no\n",
      "sooner given the provocation than prepared to support it, had not\n",
      "received the stroke on his shield. The valour that had so long been\n",
      "smothered in his breast broke forth at once; he rushed impetuously on the\n",
      "Knight, whose pride and wrath were not less powerful incentives to hardy\n",
      "deeds. The combat was furious, but not long. Theodore wounded the\n",
      "Knight in three several places, and at last disarmed him as he fainted by\n",
      "the loss of blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peasant, who had fled on the first onset, had given the alarm to some\n",
      "of Manfred’s domestics, who, by his orders, were dispersed through the\n",
      "forest in pursuit of Isabella. They came up as the Knight fell, whom\n",
      "they soon discovered to be the noble stranger. Theodore, notwithstanding\n",
      "his hatred to Manfred, could not behold the victory he had gained without\n",
      "emotions of pity and generosity. But he was more touched when he learned\n",
      "the quality of his adversary, and was informed that he was no retainer,\n",
      "but an enemy, of Manfred. He assisted the servants of the latter in\n",
      "disarming the Knight, and in endeavouring to stanch the blood that flowed\n",
      "from his wounds. The Knight recovering his speech, said, in a faint and\n",
      "faltering voice—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Generous foe, we have both been in an error. I took thee for an\n",
      "instrument of the tyrant; I perceive thou hast made the like mistake. It\n",

      "“Fetch some water,” said Theodore, “and pour it down his throat, while I\n",
      "hasten to the Princess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Saying this, he flew to Isabella, and in few words told her modestly that\n",
      "he had been so unfortunate by mistake as to wound a gentleman from her\n",
      "father’s court, who wished, ere he died, to impart something of\n",
      "consequence to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Princess, who had been transported at hearing the voice of Theodore,\n",
      "as he called to her to come forth, was astonished at what she heard.\n",
      "Suffering herself to be conducted by Theodore, the new proof of whose\n",
      "valour recalled her dispersed spirits, she came where the bleeding Knight\n",
      "lay speechless on the ground. But her fears returned when she beheld the\n",
      "domestics of Manfred. She would again have fled if Theodore had not made\n",
      "her observe that they were unarmed, and had not threatened them with\n",
      "instant death if they should dare to seize the Princess.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stranger, opening his eyes, and beholding a woman, said, “Art\n",

      "by Hippolita and Matilda, whom Isabella had sent one of the domestics\n",
      "before to advertise of their approach. The ladies causing Frederic to be\n",
      "conveyed into the nearest chamber, retired, while the surgeons examined\n",
      "his wounds. Matilda blushed at seeing Theodore and Isabella together;\n",
      "but endeavoured to conceal it by embracing the latter, and condoling with\n",
      "her on her father’s mischance. The surgeons soon came to acquaint\n",
      "Hippolita that none of the Marquis’s wounds were dangerous; and that he\n",
      "was desirous of seeing his daughter and the Princesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theodore, under pretence of expressing his joy at being freed from his\n",
      "apprehensions of the combat being fatal to Frederic, could not resist the\n",
      "impulse of following Matilda. Her eyes were so often cast down on\n",
      "meeting his, that Isabella, who regarded Theodore as attentively as he\n",
      "gazed on Matilda, soon divined who the object was that he had told her in\n",
      "the cave engaged his affections. While this mute scene passed, Hippolita\n",
      "demanded of Frederic the cause of his having taken that mysterious course\n",
      "for reclaiming his daughter; and threw in various apologies to excuse her\n",
      "Lord for the match contracted between their children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederic, however incensed against Manfred, was not insensible to the\n",
      "courtesy and benevolence of Hippolita: but he was still more struck with\n",
      "the lovely form of Matilda. Wishing to detain them by his bedside, he\n",
      "informed Hippolita of his story. He told her that, while prisoner to the\n",
      "infidels, he had dreamed that his daughter, of whom he had learned no\n",
      "news since his captivity, was detained in a castle, where she was in\n",
      "danger of the most dreadful misfortunes: and that if he obtained his\n",
      "liberty, and repaired to a wood near Joppa, he would learn more. Alarmed\n",
      "at this dream, and incapable of obeying the direction given by it, his\n",
      "chains became more grievous than ever. But while his thoughts were\n",
      "occupied on the means of obtaining his liberty, he received the agreeable\n",
      "news that the confederate Princes who were warring in Palestine had paid\n",
      "his ransom. He instantly set out for the wood that had been marked in\n",
      "his dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "For three days he and his attendants had wandered in the forest without\n",
      "seeing a human form: but on the evening of the third they came to a cell,\n",
      "in which they found a venerable hermit in the agonies of death. Applying\n",
      "rich cordials, they brought the fainting man to his speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My sons,” said he, “I am bounden to your charity—but it is in vain—I am\n",
      "going to my eternal rest—yet I die with the satisfaction of performing\n",
      "the will of heaven. When first I repaired to this solitude, after seeing\n",
      "my country become a prey to unbelievers—it is alas! above fifty years\n",
      "since I was witness to that dreadful scene! St. Nicholas appeared to me,\n",
      "and revealed a secret, which he bade me never disclose to mortal man, but\n",
      "on my death-bed. This is that tremendous hour, and ye are no doubt the\n",
      "chosen warriors to whom I was ordered to reveal my trust. As soon as ye\n",
      "have done the last offices to this wretched corse, dig under the seventh\n",
      "tree on the left hand of this poor cave, and your pains will—Oh! good\n",

      "He paused. Hippolita trembled. She did not doubt but Frederic was\n",
      "destined by heaven to accomplish the fate that seemed to threaten her\n",
      "house. Looking with anxious fondness at Matilda, a silent tear stole\n",
      "down her cheek: but recollecting herself, she said—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Proceed, my Lord; heaven does nothing in vain; mortals must receive its\n",
      "divine behests with lowliness and submission. It is our part to\n",
      "deprecate its wrath, or bow to its decrees. Repeat the sentence, my\n",
      "Lord; we listen resigned.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederic was grieved that he had proceeded so far. The dignity and\n",
      "patient firmness of Hippolita penetrated him with respect, and the tender\n",
      "silent affection with which the Princess and her daughter regarded each\n",
      "other, melted him almost to tears. Yet apprehensive that his forbearance\n",
      "to obey would be more alarming, he repeated in a faltering and low voice\n",
      "the following lines:\n",
      "\n",
      "    “Where’er a casque that suits this sword is found,\n",
      "    With perils is thy daughter compass’d round;\n",
      "    _Alfonso’s_ blood alone can save the maid,\n",
      "    And quiet a long restless Prince’s shade.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What is there in these lines,” said Theodore impatiently, “that affects\n",
      "these Princesses? Why were they to be shocked by a mysterious delicacy,\n",
      "that has so little foundation?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your words are rude, young man,” said the Marquis; “and though fortune\n",
      "has favoured you once—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My honoured Lord,” said Isabella, who resented Theodore’s warmth, which\n",
      "she perceived was dictated by his sentiments for Matilda, “discompose not\n",
      "yourself for the glosing of a peasant’s son: he forgets the reverence he\n",
      "owes you; but he is not accustomed—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hippolita, concerned at the heat that had arisen, checked Theodore for\n",
      "his boldness, but with an air acknowledging his zeal; and changing the\n",
      "conversation, demanded of Frederic where he had left her Lord? As the\n",
      "Marquis was going to reply, they heard a noise without, and rising to\n",
      "inquire the cause, Manfred, Jerome, and part of the troop, who had met an\n",
      "imperfect rumour of what had happened, entered the chamber. Manfred\n",
      "advanced hastily towards Frederic’s bed to condole with him on his\n",
      "misfortune, and to learn the circumstances of the combat, when starting\n",
      "in an agony of terror and amazement, he cried—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ha! what art thou? thou dreadful spectre! is my hour come?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“For mercy’s sweetest self, my Lord,” said Hippolita, “resume your soul,\n",
      "command your reason. There is none here, but us, your friends.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, is not that Alfonso?” cried Manfred. “Dost thou not see him? can\n",
      "it be my brain’s delirium?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This! my Lord,” said Hippolita; “this is Theodore, the youth who has\n",
      "been so unfortunate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Theodore!” said Manfred mournfully, and striking his forehead; “Theodore\n",
      "or a phantom, he has unhinged the soul of Manfred. But how comes he\n",
      "here? and how comes he in armour?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I believe he went in search of Isabella,” said Hippolita.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of Isabella!” said Manfred, relapsing into rage; “yes, yes, that is not\n",
      "doubtful—. But how did he escape from durance in which I left him? Was\n",
      "it Isabella, or this hypocritical old Friar, that procured his\n",
      "enlargement?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And would a parent be criminal, my Lord,” said Theodore, “if he\n",
      "meditated the deliverance of his child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerome, amazed to hear himself in a manner accused by his son, and\n",
      "without foundation, knew not what to think. He could not comprehend how\n",
      "Theodore had escaped, how he came to be armed, and to encounter Frederic.\n",
      "Still he would not venture to ask any questions that might tend to\n",
      "inflame Manfred’s wrath against his son. Jerome’s silence convinced\n",
      "Manfred that he had contrived Theodore’s release.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And is it thus, thou ungrateful old man,” said the Prince, addressing\n",
      "himself to the Friar, “that thou repayest mine and Hippolita’s bounties?\n",
      "And not content with traversing my heart’s nearest wishes, thou armest\n",
      "thy bastard, and bringest him into my own castle to insult me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Lord,” said Theodore, “you wrong my father: neither he nor I are\n",
      "capable of harbouring a thought against your peace. Is it insolence thus\n",
      "to surrender myself to your Highness’s pleasure?” added he, laying his\n",
      "sword respectfully at Manfred’s feet. “Behold my bosom; strike, my Lord,\n",
      "if you suspect that a disloyal thought is lodged there. There is not a\n",
      "sentiment engraven on my heart that does not venerate you and yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The grace and fervour with which Theodore uttered these words interested\n",
      "every person present in his favour. Even Manfred was touched—yet still\n",
      "possessed with his resemblance to Alfonso, his admiration was dashed with\n",
      "secret horror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rise,” said he; “thy life is not my present purpose. But tell me thy\n",
      "history, and how thou camest connected with this old traitor here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Lord,” said Jerome eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Peace! impostor!” said Manfred; “I will not have him prompted.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Lord,” said Theodore, “I want no assistance; my story is very brief.\n",
      "I was carried at five years of age to Algiers with my mother, who had\n",
      "been taken by corsairs from the coast of Sicily. She died of grief in\n",
      "less than a twelvemonth;” the tears gushed from Jerome’s eyes, on whose\n",
      "countenance a thousand anxious passions stood expressed. “Before she\n",
      "died,” continued Theodore, “she bound a writing about my arm under my\n",
      "garments, which told me I was the son of the Count Falconara.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is most true,” said Jerome; “I am that wretched father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Again I enjoin thee silence,” said Manfred: “proceed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I remained in slavery,” said Theodore, “until within these two years,\n",
      "when attending on my master in his cruises, I was delivered by a\n",
      "Christian vessel, which overpowered the pirate; and discovering myself to\n",
      "the captain, he generously put me on shore in Sicily; but alas! instead\n",
      "of finding a father, I learned that his estate, which was situated on the\n",
      "coast, had, during his absence, been laid waste by the Rover who had\n",
      "carried my mother and me into captivity: that his castle had been burnt\n",
      "to the ground, and that my father on his return had sold what remained,\n",
      "and was retired into religion in the kingdom of Naples, but where no man\n",
      "could inform me. Destitute and friendless, hopeless almost of attaining\n",
      "the transport of a parent’s embrace, I took the first opportunity of\n",
      "setting sail for Naples, from whence, within these six days, I wandered\n",
      "into this province, still supporting myself by the labour of my hands;\n",
      "nor until yester-morn did I believe that heaven had reserved any lot for\n",
      "me but peace of mind and contented poverty. This, my Lord, is Theodore’s\n",
      "story. I am blessed beyond my hope in finding a father; I am unfortunate\n",
      "beyond my desert in having incurred your Highness’s displeasure.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He ceased. A murmur of approbation gently arose from the audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not all,” said Frederic; “I am bound in honour to add what he\n",
      "suppresses. Though he is modest, I must be generous; he is one of the\n",
      "bravest youths on Christian ground. He is warm too; and from the short\n",
      "knowledge I have of him, I will pledge myself for his veracity: if what\n",
      "he reports of himself were not true, he would not utter it—and for me,\n",
      "youth, I honour a frankness which becomes thy birth; but now, and thou\n",
      "didst offend me: yet the noble blood which flows in thy veins, may well\n",
      "be allowed to boil out, when it has so recently traced itself to its\n",
      "source. Come, my Lord,” (turning to Manfred), “if I can pardon him,\n",
      "surely you may; it is not the youth’s fault, if you took him for a\n",
      "spectre.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This bitter taunt galled the soul of Manfred.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If beings from another world,” replied he haughtily, “have power to\n",
      "impress my mind with awe, it is more than living man can do; nor could a\n",
      "stripling’s arm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My Lord,” interrupted Hippolita, “your guest has occasion for repose:\n",
      "shall we not leave him to his rest?” Saying this, and taking Manfred by\n",
      "the hand, she took leave of Frederic, and led the company forth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prince, not sorry to quit a conversation which recalled to mind the\n",
      "discovery he had made of his most secret sensations, suffered himself to\n",
      "be conducted to his own apartment, after permitting Theodore, though\n",
      "under engagement to return to the castle on the morrow (a condition the\n",
      "young man gladly accepted), to retire with his father to the convent.\n",
      "Matilda and Isabella were too much occupied with their own reflections,\n",
      "and too little content with each other, to wish for farther converse that\n",
      "night. They separated each to her chamber, with more expressions of\n",
      "ceremony and fewer of affection than had passed between them since their\n",
      "childhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "If they parted with small cordiality, they did but meet with greater\n",
      "impatience, as soon as the sun was risen. Their minds were in a\n",
      "situation that excluded sleep, and each recollected a thousand questions\n",
      "which she wished she had put to the other overnight. Matilda reflected\n",
      "that Isabella had been twice delivered by Theodore in very critical\n",
      "situations, which she could not believe accidental. His eyes, it was\n",
      "true, had been fixed on her in Frederic’s chamber; but that might have\n",
      "been to disguise his passion for Isabella from the fathers of both. It\n",
      "were better to clear this up. She wished to know the truth, lest she\n",
      "should wrong her friend by entertaining a passion for Isabella’s lover.\n",
      "Thus jealousy prompted, and at the same time borrowed an excuse from\n",
      "friendship to justify its curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabella, not less restless, had better foundation for her suspicions.\n",
      "Both Theodore’s tongue and eyes had told her his heart was engaged; it\n",
      "was true—yet, perhaps, Matilda might not correspond to his passion; she\n",
      "had ever appeared insensible to love: all her thoughts were set on\n",
      "heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did I dissuade her?” said Isabella to herself; “I am punished for my\n",
      "generosity; but when did they meet? where? It cannot be; I have deceived\n",
      "myself; perhaps last night was the first time they ever beheld each\n",
      "other; it must be some other object that has prepossessed his\n",
      "affections—if it is, I am not so unhappy as I thought; if it is not my\n",
      "friend Matilda—how! Can I stoop to wish for the affection of a man, who\n",
      "rudely and unnecessarily acquainted me with his indifference? and that at\n",
      "the very moment in which common courtesy demanded at least expressions of\n",
      "civility. I will go to my dear Matilda, who will confirm me in this\n",
      "becoming pride. Man is false—I will advise with her on taking the veil:\n",
      "she will rejoice to find me in this disposition; and I will acquaint her\n",
      "that I no longer oppose her inclination for the cloister.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In this frame of mind, and determined to open her heart entirely to\n",
      "Matilda, she went to that Princess’s chamber, whom she found already\n",
      "dressed, and leaning pensively on her arm. This attitude, so\n",
      "correspondent to what she felt herself, revived Isabella’s suspicions,\n",
      "and destroyed the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend.\n",
      "They blushed at meeting, and were too much novices to disguise their\n",
      "sensations with address. After some unmeaning questions and replies,\n",
      "Matilda demanded of Isabella the cause of her flight? The latter, who\n",
      "had almost forgotten Manfred’s passion, so entirely was she occupied by\n",
      "her own, concluding that Matilda referred to her last escape from the\n",
      "convent, which had occasioned the events of the preceding evening,\n",
      "replied—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Martelli brought word to the convent that your mother was dead.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” said Matilda, interrupting her, “Bianca has explained that mistake\n",
      "to me: on seeing me faint, she cried out, ‘The Princess is dead!’ and\n",
      "Martelli, who had come for the usual dole to the castle—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And what made you faint?” said Isabella, indifferent to the rest.\n",
      "Matilda blushed and stammered—\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father—he was sitting in judgment on a criminal—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What criminal?” said Isabella eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A young man,” said Matilda; “I believe—I think it was that young man that—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What, Theodore?” said Isabella.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” answered she; “I never saw him before; I do not know how he had\n",
      "offended my father, but as he has been of service to you, I am glad my\n",
      "Lord has pardoned him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Served me!” replied Isabella; “do you term it serving me, to wound my\n",
      "father, and almost occasion his death? Though it is but since yesterday\n",
      "that I am blessed with knowing a parent, I hope Matilda does not think I\n",
      "am such a stranger to filial tenderness as not to resent the boldness of\n",
      "that audacious youth, and that it is impossible for me ever to feel any\n",
      "affection for one who dared to lift his arm against the author of my\n",
      "being. No, Matilda, my heart abhors him; and if you still retain the\n",
      "friendship for me that you have vowed from your infancy, you will detest\n",
      "a man who has been on the point of making me miserable for ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Matilda held down her head and replied: “I hope my dearest Isabella does\n",
      "not doubt her Matilda’s friendship: I never beheld that youth until\n",
      "yesterday; he is almost a stranger to me: but as the surgeons have\n",
      "pronounced your father out of danger, you ought not to harbour\n",
      "uncharitable resentment against one, who I am persuaded did not know the\n",
      "Marquis was related to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You plead his cause very pathetically,” said Isabella, “considering he\n",
      "is so much a stranger to you! I am mistaken, or he returns your\n",
      "charity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What mean you?” said Matilda.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nothing,” said Isabella, repenting that she had given Matilda a hint of\n",
      "Theodore’s inclination for her. Then changing the discourse, she asked\n",
      "Matilda what occasioned Manfred to take Theodore for a spectre?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bless me,” said Matilda, “did not you observe his extreme resemblance to\n",
      "the portrait of Alfonso in the gallery? I took notice of it to Bianca\n",
      "even before I saw him in armour; but with the helmet on, he is the very\n",
      "image of that picture.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not much observe pictures,” said Isabella: “much less have I\n",
      "examined this young man so attentively as you seem to have done. Ah?\n",
      "Matilda, your heart is in danger, but let me warn you as a friend, he has\n",
      "owned to me that he is in love; it cannot be with you, for yesterday was\n",
      "the first time you ever met—was it not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Certainly,” replied Matilda; “but why does my dearest Isabella conclude\n",
      "from anything I have said, that”—she paused—then continuing: “he saw you\n",
      "first, and I am far from having the vanity to think that my little\n",
      "portion of charms could engage a heart devoted to you; may you be happy,\n",
      "Isabella, whatever is the fate of Matilda!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My lovely friend,” said Isabella, whose heart was too honest to resist a\n",
      "kind expression, “it is you that Theodore admires; I saw it; I am\n",
      "persuaded of it; nor shall a thought of my own happiness suffer me to\n",
      "interfere with yours.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This frankness drew tears from the gentle Matilda; and jealousy that for\n",
      "a moment had raised a coolness between these amiable maidens soon gave\n",
      "way to the natural sincerity and candour of their souls. Each confessed\n",
      "to the other the impression that Theodore had made on her; and this\n",
      "confidence was followed by a struggle of generosity, each insisting on\n",
      "yielding her claim to her friend. At length the dignity of Isabella’s\n",
      "virtue reminding her of the preference which Theodore had almost declared\n",
      "for her rival, made her determine to conquer her passion, and cede the\n",
      "beloved object to her friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this contest of amity, Hippolita entered her daughter’s chamber.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madam,” said she to Isabella, “you have so much tenderness for Matilda,\n",
      "and interest yourself so kindly in whatever affects our wretched house,\n",
      "that I can have no secrets with my child which are not proper for you to\n",
      "hear.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The princesses were all attention and anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Know then, Madam,” continued Hippolita, “and you my dearest Matilda,\n",
      "that being convinced by all the events of these two last ominous days,\n",
      "that heaven purposes the sceptre of Otranto should pass from Manfred’s\n",
      "hands into those of the Marquis Frederic, I have been perhaps inspired\n",
      "with the thought of averting our total destruction by the union of our\n",
      "rival houses. With this view I have been proposing to Manfred, my lord,\n",
      "to tender this dear, dear child to Frederic, your father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Me to Lord Frederic!” cried Matilda; “good heavens! my gracious\n",
      "mother—and have you named it to my father?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have,” said Hippolita; “he listened benignly to my proposal, and is\n",
      "gone to break it to the Marquis.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! wretched princess!” cried Isabella; “what hast thou done! what ruin\n",
      "has thy inadvertent goodness been preparing for thyself, for me, and for\n",
      "Matilda!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ruin from me to you and to my child!” said Hippolita “what can this\n",
      "mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alas!” said Isabella, “the purity of your own heart prevents your seeing\n",
      "the depravity of others. Manfred, your lord, that impious man—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold,” said Hippolita; “you must not in my presence, young lady, mention\n",
      "Manfred with disrespect: he is my lord and husband, and—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will not long be so,” said Isabella, “if his wicked purposes can be\n",
      "carried into execution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This language amazes me,” said Hippolita. “Your feeling, Isabella, is\n",
      "warm; but until this hour I never knew it betray you into intemperance.\n",
      "What deed of Manfred authorises you to treat him as a murderer, an\n",
      "assassin?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou virtuous, and too credulous Princess!” replied Isabella; “it is not\n",
      "thy life he aims at—it is to separate himself from thee! to divorce thee!\n",
      "to—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To divorce me!” “To divorce my mother!” cried Hippolita and Matilda at\n",
      "once.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” said Isabella; “and to complete his crime, he meditates—I cannot\n",
      "speak it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What can surpass what thou hast already uttered?” said Matilda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hippolita was silent. Grief choked her speech; and the recollection of\n",
      "Manfred’s late ambiguous discourses confirmed what she heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Excellent, dear lady! madam! mother!” cried Isabella, flinging herself\n",
      "at Hippolita’s feet in a transport of passion; “trust me, believe me, I\n",
      "will die a thousand deaths sooner than consent to injure you, than yield\n",
      "to so odious—oh!—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is too much!” cried Hippolita: “What crimes does one crime suggest!\n",
      "Rise, dear Isabella; I do not doubt your virtue. Oh! Matilda, this\n",
      "stroke is too heavy for thee! weep not, my child; and not a murmur, I\n",
      "charge thee. Remember, he is thy father still!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you are my mother too,” said Matilda fervently; “and you are\n",
      "virtuous, you are guiltless!—Oh! must not I, must not I complain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must not,” said Hippolita—“come, all will yet be well. Manfred, in\n",
      "the agony for the loss of thy brother, knew not what he said; perhaps\n",
      "Isabella misunderstood him; his heart is good—and, my child, thou knowest\n",
      "not all! There is a destiny hangs over us; the hand of Providence is\n",

      "she in a firmer tone, “perhaps the sacrifice of myself may atone for all;\n",
      "I will go and offer myself to this divorce—it boots not what becomes of\n",
      "me. I will withdraw into the neighbouring monastery, and waste the\n",
      "remainder of life in prayers and tears for my child and—the Prince!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art as much too good for this world,” said Isabella, “as Manfred is\n",
      "execrable; but think not, lady, that thy weakness shall determine for me.\n",
      "I swear, hear me all ye angels—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop, I adjure thee,” cried Hippolita: “remember thou dost not depend on\n",
      "thyself; thou hast a father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father is too pious, too noble,” interrupted Isabella, “to command an\n",
      "impious deed. But should he command it; can a father enjoin a cursed\n",
      "act? I was contracted to the son, can I wed the father? No, madam, no;\n",
      "force should not drag me to Manfred’s hated bed. I loathe him, I abhor\n",
      "him: divine and human laws forbid—and my friend, my dearest Matilda!\n",
      "would I wound her tender soul by injuring her adored mother? my own\n",
      "mother—I never have known another”—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! she is the mother of both!” cried Matilda: “can we, can we,\n",
      "Isabella, adore her too much?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My lovely children,” said the touched Hippolita, “your tenderness\n",
      "overpowers me—but I must not give way to it. It is not ours to make\n",
      "election for ourselves: heaven, our fathers, and our husbands must decide\n",
      "for us. Have patience until you hear what Manfred and Frederic have\n",
      "determined. If the Marquis accepts Matilda’s hand, I know she will\n",
      "readily obey. Heaven may interpose and prevent the rest. What means my\n",
      "child?” continued she, seeing Matilda fall at her feet with a flood of\n",
      "speechless tears—“But no; answer me not, my daughter: I must not hear a\n",
      "word against the pleasure of thy father.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! doubt not my obedience, my dreadful obedience to him and to you!”\n",
      "said Matilda. “But can I, most respected of women, can I experience all\n",
      "this tenderness, this world of goodness, and conceal a thought from the\n",
      "best of mothers?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What art thou going to utter?” said Isabella trembling. “Recollect\n",
      "thyself, Matilda.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, Isabella,” said the Princess, “I should not deserve this\n",
      "incomparable parent, if the inmost recesses of my soul harboured a\n",
      "thought without her permission—nay, I have offended her; I have suffered\n",
      "a passion to enter my heart without her avowal—but here I disclaim it;\n",
      "here I vow to heaven and her—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My child! my child;” said Hippolita, “what words are these! what new\n",
      "calamities has fate in store for us! Thou, a passion? Thou, in this\n",
      "hour of destruction—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! I see all my guilt!” said Matilda. “I abhor myself, if I cost my\n",
      "mother a pang. She is the dearest thing I have on earth—Oh! I will\n",
      "never, never behold him more!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Isabella,” said Hippolita, “thou art conscious to this unhappy secret,\n",
      "whatever it is. Speak!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” cried Matilda, “have I so forfeited my mother’s love, that she\n",
      "will not permit me even to speak my own guilt? oh! wretched, wretched\n",
      "Matilda!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art too cruel,” said Isabella to Hippolita: “canst thou behold this\n",
      "anguish of a virtuous mind, and not commiserate it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not pity my child!” said Hippolita, catching Matilda in her arms—“Oh! I\n",
      "know she is good, she is all virtue, all tenderness, and duty. I do\n",
      "forgive thee, my excellent, my only hope!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The princesses then revealed to Hippolita their mutual inclination for\n",
      "Theodore, and the purpose of Isabella to resign him to Matilda.\n",
      "Hippolita blamed their imprudence, and showed them the improbability that\n",
      "either father would consent to bestow his heiress on so poor a man,\n",
      "though nobly born. Some comfort it gave her to find their passion of so\n",
      "recent a date, and that Theodore had had but little cause to suspect it\n",
      "in either. She strictly enjoined them to avoid all correspondence with\n",
      "him. This Matilda fervently promised: but Isabella, who flattered\n",
      "herself that she meant no more than to promote his union with her friend,\n",
      "could not determine to avoid him; and made no reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will go to the convent,” said Hippolita, “and order new masses to be\n",
      "said for a deliverance from these calamities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! my mother,” said Matilda, “you mean to quit us: you mean to take\n",
      "sanctuary, and to give my father an opportunity of pursuing his fatal\n",
      "intention. Alas! on my knees I supplicate you to forbear; will you leave\n",
      "me a prey to Frederic? I will follow you to the convent.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be at peace, my child,” said Hippolita: “I will return instantly. I\n",
      "will never abandon thee, until I know it is the will of heaven, and for\n",
      "thy benefit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do not deceive me,” said Matilda. “I will not marry Frederic until thou\n",
      "commandest it. Alas! what will become of me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why that exclamation?” said Hippolita. “I have promised thee to\n",
      "return—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah! my mother,” replied Matilda, “stay and save me from myself. A frown\n",
      "from thee can do more than all my father’s severity. I have given away\n",
      "my heart, and you alone can make me recall it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No more,” said Hippolita; “thou must not relapse, Matilda.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can quit Theodore,” said she, “but must I wed another? let me attend\n",
      "thee to the altar, and shut myself from the world for ever.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thy fate depends on thy father,” said Hippolita; “I have ill-bestowed my\n",
      "tenderness, if it has taught thee to revere aught beyond him. Adieu! my\n",
      "child: I go to pray for thee.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hippolita’s real purpose was to demand of Jerome, whether in conscience\n",
      "she might not consent to the divorce. She had oft urged Manfred to\n",
      "resign the principality, which the delicacy of her conscience rendered an\n",
      "hourly burthen to her. These scruples concurred to make the separation\n",
      "from her husband appear less dreadful to her than it would have seemed in\n",
      "any other situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerome, at quitting the castle overnight, had questioned Theodore\n",
      "severely why he had accused him to Manfred of being privy to his escape.\n",
      "Theodore owned it had been with design to prevent Manfred’s suspicion\n",
      "from alighting on Matilda; and added, the holiness of Jerome’s life and\n",
      "character secured him from the tyrant’s wrath. Jerome was heartily\n",
      "grieved to discover his son’s inclination for that princess; and leaving\n",
      "him to his rest, promised in the morning to acquaint him with important\n",
      "reasons for conquering his passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theodore, like Isabella, was too recently acquainted with parental\n",
      "authority to submit to its decisions against the impulse of his heart.\n",
      "He had little curiosity to learn the Friar’s reasons, and less\n",
      "disposition to obey them. The lovely Matilda had made stronger\n",
      "impressions on him than filial affection. All night he pleased himself\n",
      "with visions of love; and it was not till late after the morning-office,\n",
      "that he recollected the Friar’s commands to attend him at Alfonso’s tomb.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Young man,” said Jerome, when he saw him, “this tardiness does not\n",
      "please me. Have a father’s commands already so little weight?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Theodore made awkward excuses, and attributed his delay to having\n",
      "overslept himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And on whom were thy dreams employed?” said the Friar sternly. His son\n",
      "blushed. “Come, come,” resumed the Friar, “inconsiderate youth, this\n",
      "must not be; eradicate this guilty passion from thy breast—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Guilty passion!” cried Theodore: “Can guilt dwell with innocent beauty\n",
      "and virtuous modesty?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is sinful,” replied the Friar, “to cherish those whom heaven has\n",
      "doomed to destruction. A tyrant’s race must be swept from the earth to\n",
      "the third and fourth generation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Will heaven visit the innocent for the crimes of the guilty?” said\n",
      "Theodore. “The fair Matilda has virtues enough—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To undo thee:” interrupted Jerome. “Hast thou so soon forgotten that\n",
      "twice the savage Manfred has pronounced thy sentence?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nor have I forgotten, sir,” said Theodore, “that the charity of his\n",
      "daughter delivered me from his power. I can forget injuries, but never\n",
      "benefits.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The injuries thou hast received from Manfred’s race,” said the Friar,\n",
      "“are beyond what thou canst conceive. Reply not, but view this holy\n",
      "image! Beneath this marble monument rest the ashes of the good Alfonso;\n",
      "a prince adorned with every virtue: the father of his people! the delight\n",
      "of mankind! Kneel, headstrong boy, and list, while a father unfolds a\n",
      "tale of horror that will expel every sentiment from thy soul, but\n",
      "sensations of sacred vengeance—Alfonso! much injured prince! let thy\n",
      "unsatisfied shade sit awful on the troubled air, while these trembling\n",
      "lips—Ha! who comes there?—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The most wretched of women!” said Hippolita, entering the choir. “Good\n",
      "Father, art thou at leisure?—but why this kneeling youth? what means the\n",
      "horror imprinted on each countenance? why at this venerable tomb—alas!\n",
      "hast thou seen aught?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We were pouring forth our orisons to heaven,” replied the Friar, with\n",
      "some confusion, “to put an end to the woes of this deplorable province.\n",
      "Join with us, Lady! thy spotless soul may obtain an exemption from the\n",
      "judgments which the portents of these days but too speakingly denounce\n",
      "against thy house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I pray fervently to heaven to divert them,” said the pious Princess.\n",
      "“Thou knowest it has been the occupation of my life to wrest a blessing\n",
      "for my Lord and my harmless children.—One alas! is taken from me! would\n",
      "heaven but hear me for my poor Matilda! Father! intercede for her!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Every heart will bless her,” cried Theodore with rapture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be dumb, rash youth!” said Jerome. “And thou, fond Princess, contend\n",
      "not with the Powers above! the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away:\n",
      "bless His holy name, and submit to his decrees.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do most devoutly,” said Hippolita; “but will He not spare my only\n",
      "comfort? must Matilda perish too?—ah! Father, I came—but dismiss thy\n",
      "son. No ear but thine must hear what I have to utter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“May heaven grant thy every wish, most excellent Princess!” said Theodore\n",
      "retiring. Jerome frowned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hippolita then acquainted the Friar with the proposal she had suggested\n",
      "to Manfred, his approbation of it, and the tender of Matilda that he was\n",
      "gone to make to Frederic. Jerome could not conceal his dislike of the\n",
      "notion, which he covered under pretence of the improbability that\n",
      "Frederic, the nearest of blood to Alfonso, and who was come to claim his\n",
      "succession, would yield to an alliance with the usurper of his right.\n",
      "But nothing could equal the perplexity of the Friar, when Hippolita\n",
      "confessed her readiness not to oppose the separation, and demanded his\n",
      "opinion on the legality of her acquiescence. The Friar caught eagerly at\n",
      "her request of his advice, and without explaining his aversion to the\n",
      "proposed marriage of Manfred and Isabella, he painted to Hippolita in the\n",
      "most alarming colours the sinfulness of her consent, denounced judgments\n",
      "against her if she complied, and enjoined her in the severest terms to\n",
      "treat any such proposition with every mark of indignation and refusal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, in the meantime, had broken his purpose to Frederic, and\n",
      "proposed the double marriage. That weak Prince, who had been struck with\n",
      "the charms of Matilda, listened but too eagerly to the offer. He forgot\n",
      "his enmity to Manfred, whom he saw but little hope of dispossessing by\n",
      "force; and flattering himself that no issue might succeed from the union\n",
      "of his daughter with the tyrant, he looked upon his own succession to the\n",
      "principality as facilitated by wedding Matilda. He made faint opposition\n",
      "to the proposal; affecting, for form only, not to acquiesce unless\n",
      "Hippolita should consent to the divorce. Manfred took that upon himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transported with his success, and impatient to see himself in a situation\n",
      "to expect sons, he hastened to his wife’s apartment, determined to extort\n",
      "her compliance. He learned with indignation that she was absent at the\n",
      "convent. His guilt suggested to him that she had probably been informed\n",
      "by Isabella of his purpose. He doubted whether her retirement to the\n",
      "convent did not import an intention of remaining there, until she could\n",
      "raise obstacles to their divorce; and the suspicions he had already\n",
      "entertained of Jerome, made him apprehend that the Friar would not only\n",
      "traverse his views, but might have inspired Hippolita with the resolution\n",
      "of taking sanctuary. Impatient to unravel this clue, and to defeat its\n",
      "success, Manfred hastened to the convent, and arrived there as the Friar\n",
      "was earnestly exhorting the Princess never to yield to the divorce.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Madam,” said Manfred, “what business drew you hither? why did you not\n",
      "await my return from the Marquis?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I came to implore a blessing on your councils,” replied Hippolita.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My councils do not need a Friar’s intervention,” said Manfred; “and of\n",
      "all men living is that hoary traitor the only one whom you delight to\n",
      "confer with?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Profane Prince!” said Jerome; “is it at the altar that thou choosest to\n",
      "insult the servants of the altar?—but, Manfred, thy impious schemes are\n",
      "known. Heaven and this virtuous lady know them—nay, frown not, Prince.\n",
      "The Church despises thy menaces. Her thunders will be heard above thy\n",
      "wrath. Dare to proceed in thy cursed purpose of a divorce, until her\n",
      "sentence be known, and here I lance her anathema at thy head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Audacious rebel!” said Manfred, endeavouring to conceal the awe with\n",
      "which the Friar’s words inspired him. “Dost thou presume to threaten thy\n",
      "lawful Prince?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art no lawful Prince,” said Jerome; “thou art no Prince—go, discuss\n",
      "thy claim with Frederic; and when that is done—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is done,” replied Manfred; “Frederic accepts Matilda’s hand, and is\n",
      "content to waive his claim, unless I have no male issue”—as he spoke\n",
      "those words three drops of blood fell from the nose of Alfonso’s statue.\n",
      "Manfred turned pale, and the Princess sank on her knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Behold!” said the Friar; “mark this miraculous indication that the blood\n",
      "of Alfonso will never mix with that of Manfred!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My gracious Lord,” said Hippolita, “let us submit ourselves to heaven.\n",
      "Think not thy ever obedient wife rebels against thy authority. I have no\n",
      "will but that of my Lord and the Church. To that revered tribunal let us\n",
      "appeal. It does not depend on us to burst the bonds that unite us. If\n",
      "the Church shall approve the dissolution of our marriage, be it so—I have\n",
      "but few years, and those of sorrow, to pass. Where can they be worn away\n",
      "so well as at the foot of this altar, in prayers for thine and Matilda’s\n",
      "safety?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But thou shalt not remain here until then,” said Manfred. “Repair with\n",
      "me to the castle, and there I will advise on the proper measures for a\n",
      "divorce;—but this meddling Friar comes not thither; my hospitable roof\n",
      "shall never more harbour a traitor—and for thy Reverence’s offspring,”\n",
      "continued he, “I banish him from my dominions. He, I ween, is no sacred\n",
      "personage, nor under the protection of the Church. Whoever weds\n",
      "Isabella, it shall not be Father Falconara’s started-up son.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They start up,” said the Friar, “who are suddenly beheld in the seat of\n",
      "lawful Princes; but they wither away like the grass, and their place\n",
      "knows them no more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, casting a look of scorn at the Friar, led Hippolita forth; but\n",
      "at the door of the church whispered one of his attendants to remain\n",
      "concealed about the convent, and bring him instant notice, if any one\n",

      "CHAPTER V.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Every reflection which Manfred made on the Friar’s behaviour, conspired\n",
      "to persuade him that Jerome was privy to an amour between Isabella and\n",
      "Theodore. But Jerome’s new presumption, so dissonant from his former\n",
      "meekness, suggested still deeper apprehensions. The Prince even\n",
      "suspected that the Friar depended on some secret support from Frederic,\n",
      "whose arrival, coinciding with the novel appearance of Theodore, seemed\n",
      "to bespeak a correspondence. Still more was he troubled with the\n",
      "resemblance of Theodore to Alfonso’s portrait. The latter he knew had\n",
      "unquestionably died without issue. Frederic had consented to bestow\n",
      "Isabella on him. These contradictions agitated his mind with numberless\n",
      "pangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw but two methods of extricating himself from his difficulties. The\n",
      "one was to resign his dominions to the Marquis—pride, ambition, and his\n",
      "reliance on ancient prophecies, which had pointed out a possibility of\n",
      "his preserving them to his posterity, combated that thought. The other\n",
      "was to press his marriage with Isabella. After long ruminating on these\n",
      "anxious thoughts, as he marched silently with Hippolita to the castle, he\n",
      "at last discoursed with that Princess on the subject of his disquiet, and\n",
      "used every insinuating and plausible argument to extract her consent to,\n",
      "even her promise of promoting the divorce. Hippolita needed little\n",
      "persuasions to bend her to his pleasure. She endeavoured to win him over\n",
      "to the measure of resigning his dominions; but finding her exhortations\n",
      "fruitless, she assured him, that as far as her conscience would allow,\n",
      "she would raise no opposition to a separation, though without better\n",
      "founded scruples than what he yet alleged, she would not engage to be\n",
      "active in demanding it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This compliance, though inadequate, was sufficient to raise Manfred’s\n",
      "hopes. He trusted that his power and wealth would easily advance his\n",
      "suit at the court of Rome, whither he resolved to engage Frederic to take\n",
      "a journey on purpose. That Prince had discovered so much passion for\n",
      "Matilda, that Manfred hoped to obtain all he wished by holding out or\n",
      "withdrawing his daughter’s charms, according as the Marquis should appear\n",
      "more or less disposed to co-operate in his views. Even the absence of\n",
      "Frederic would be a material point gained, until he could take further\n",
      "measures for his security.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dismissing Hippolita to her apartment, he repaired to that of the\n",
      "Marquis; but crossing the great hall through which he was to pass he met\n",
      "Bianca. The damsel he knew was in the confidence of both the young\n",
      "ladies. It immediately occurred to him to sift her on the subject of\n",
      "Isabella and Theodore. Calling her aside into the recess of the oriel\n",
      "window of the hall, and soothing her with many fair words and promises,\n",
      "he demanded of her whether she knew aught of the state of Isabella’s\n",
      "affections.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I! my Lord! no my Lord—yes my Lord—poor Lady! she is wonderfully alarmed\n",
      "about her father’s wounds; but I tell her he will do well; don’t your\n",
      "Highness think so?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do not ask you,” replied Manfred, “what she thinks about her father;\n",
      "but you are in her secrets. Come, be a good girl and tell me; is there\n",
      "any young man—ha!—you understand me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord bless me! understand your Highness? no, not I. I told her a few\n",
      "vulnerary herbs and repose—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not talking,” replied the Prince, impatiently, “about her father; I\n",
      "know he will do well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bless me, I rejoice to hear your Highness say so; for though I thought\n",
      "it not right to let my young Lady despond, methought his greatness had a\n",
      "wan look, and a something—I remember when young Ferdinand was wounded by\n",
      "the Venetian—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou answerest from the point,” interrupted Manfred; “but here, take\n",
      "this jewel, perhaps that may fix thy attention—nay, no reverences; my\n",
      "favour shall not stop here—come, tell me truly; how stands Isabella’s\n",

      "\n",
      "“It shall not, it shall not,” cried Manfred.\n",

      "“Nay, but swear, your Highness.”\n",

      "“By my halidame, if it should ever be known that I said it—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, truth is truth, I do not think my Lady Isabella ever much\n",
      "affectioned my young Lord your son; yet he was a sweet youth as one\n",
      "should see; I am sure, if I had been a Princess—but bless me! I must\n",
      "attend my Lady Matilda; she will marvel what is become of me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stay,” cried Manfred; “thou hast not satisfied my question. Hast thou\n",

      "\n",
      "“I! good gracious!” cried Bianca; “I carry a letter? I would not to be a\n",

      "your Highness never hear what Count Marsigli offered me, when he came a\n",
      "wooing to my Lady Matilda?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not leisure,” said Manfred, “to listen to thy tale. I do not\n",

      "\n",
      "“Nay, there is nothing can escape your Highness!” said Bianca; “not that\n",
      "I know any thing of the matter. Theodore, to be sure, is a proper young\n",
      "man, and, as my Lady Matilda says, the very image of good Alfonso. Has\n",
      "not your Highness remarked it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, yes,—No—thou torturest me,” said Manfred. “Where did they meet?\n",
      "when?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who! my Lady Matilda?” said Bianca.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no, not Matilda: Isabella; when did Isabella first become acquainted\n",
      "with this Theodore!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Virgin Mary!” said Bianca, “how should I know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou dost know,” said Manfred; “and I must know; I will—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord! your Highness is not jealous of young Theodore!” said Bianca.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jealous! no, no. Why should I be jealous? perhaps I mean to unite\n",
      "them—If I were sure Isabella would have no repugnance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Repugnance! no, I’ll warrant her,” said Bianca; “he is as comely a youth\n",
      "as ever trod on Christian ground. We are all in love with him; there is\n",
      "not a soul in the castle but would be rejoiced to have him for our\n",

      "itself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Indeed!” said Manfred, “has it gone so far! oh! this cursed Friar!—but I\n",
      "must not lose time—go, Bianca, attend Isabella; but I charge thee, not a\n",
      "word of what has passed. Find out how she is affected towards Theodore;\n",
      "bring me good news, and that ring has a companion. Wait at the foot of\n",
      "the winding staircase: I am going to visit the Marquis, and will talk\n",
      "further with thee at my return.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, after some general conversation, desired Frederic to dismiss the\n",
      "two Knights, his companions, having to talk with him on urgent affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as they were alone, he began in artful guise to sound the Marquis\n",
      "on the subject of Matilda; and finding him disposed to his wish, he let\n",
      "drop hints on the difficulties that would attend the celebration of their\n",
      "marriage, unless—At that instant Bianca burst into the room with a\n",
      "wildness in her look and gestures that spoke the utmost terror.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh! the hand! the Giant! the hand!—support me! I am terrified out of my\n",
      "senses,” cried Bianca. “I will not sleep in the castle to-night. Where\n",
      "shall I go? my things may come after me to-morrow—would I had been\n",
      "content to wed Francesco! this comes of ambition!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What has terrified thee thus, young woman?” said the Marquis. “Thou art\n",
      "safe here; be not alarmed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! your Greatness is wonderfully good,” said Bianca, “but I dare\n",
      "not—no, pray let me go—I had rather leave everything behind me, than stay\n",
      "another hour under this roof.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go to, thou hast lost thy senses,” said Manfred. “Interrupt us not; we\n",

      "fits—Come with me, Bianca.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! the Saints! No,” said Bianca, “for certain it comes to warn your\n",
      "Highness; why should it appear to me else? I say my prayers morning and\n",
      "evening—oh! if your Highness had believed Diego! ’Tis the same hand that\n",
      "he saw the foot to in the gallery-chamber—Father Jerome has often told us\n",
      "the prophecy would be out one of these days—‘Bianca,’ said he, ‘mark my\n",
      "words—’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou ravest,” said Manfred, in a rage; “be gone, and keep these\n",
      "fooleries to frighten thy companions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! my Lord,” cried Bianca, “do you think I have seen nothing? go to\n",
      "the foot of the great stairs yourself—as I live I saw it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Saw what? tell us, fair maid, what thou hast seen,” said Frederic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can your Highness listen,” said Manfred, “to the delirium of a silly\n",
      "wench, who has heard stories of apparitions until she believes them?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is more than fancy,” said the Marquis; “her terror is too natural\n",
      "and too strongly impressed to be the work of imagination. Tell us, fair\n",
      "maiden, what it is has moved thee thus?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, my Lord, thank your Greatness,” said Bianca; “I believe I look very\n",
      "pale; I shall be better when I have recovered myself—I was going to my\n",
      "Lady Isabella’s chamber, by his Highness’s order—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do not want the circumstances,” interrupted Manfred. “Since his\n",
      "Highness will have it so, proceed; but be brief.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord! your Highness thwarts one so!” replied Bianca; “I fear my hair—I\n",
      "am sure I never in my life—well! as I was telling your Greatness, I was\n",
      "going by his Highness’s order to my Lady Isabella’s chamber; she lies in\n",
      "the watchet-coloured chamber, on the right hand, one pair of stairs: so\n",
      "when I came to the great stairs—I was looking on his Highness’s present\n",
      "here—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Grant me patience!” said Manfred, “will this wench never come to the\n",
      "point? what imports it to the Marquis, that I gave thee a bauble for thy\n",
      "faithful attendance on my daughter? we want to know what thou sawest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was going to tell your Highness,” said Bianca, “if you would permit\n",
      "me. So as I was rubbing the ring—I am sure I had not gone up three\n",
      "steps, but I heard the rattling of armour; for all the world such a\n",
      "clatter as Diego says he heard when the Giant turned him about in the\n",
      "gallery-chamber.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What Giant is this, my Lord?” said the Marquis; “is your castle haunted\n",
      "by giants and goblins?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lord! what, has not your Greatness heard the story of the Giant in the\n",
      "gallery-chamber?” cried Bianca. “I marvel his Highness has not told you;\n",
      "mayhap you do not know there is a prophecy—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This trifling is intolerable,” interrupted Manfred. “Let us dismiss\n",
      "this silly wench, my Lord! we have more important affairs to discuss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“By your favour,” said Frederic, “these are no trifles. The enormous\n",
      "sabre I was directed to in the wood, yon casque, its fellow—are these\n",
      "visions of this poor maiden’s brain?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So Jaquez thinks, may it please your Greatness,” said Bianca. “He says\n",
      "this moon will not be out without our seeing some strange revolution.\n",
      "For my part, I should not be surprised if it was to happen to-morrow;\n",
      "for, as I was saying, when I heard the clattering of armour, I was all in\n",
      "a cold sweat. I looked up, and, if your Greatness will believe me, I saw\n",
      "upon the uppermost banister of the great stairs a hand in armour as big\n",
      "as big. I thought I should have swooned. I never stopped until I came\n",
      "hither—would I were well out of this castle. My Lady Matilda told me but\n",
      "yester-morning that her Highness Hippolita knows something.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou art an insolent!” cried Manfred. “Lord Marquis, it much misgives\n",
      "me that this scene is concerted to affront me. Are my own domestics\n",
      "suborned to spread tales injurious to my honour? Pursue your claim by\n",
      "manly daring; or let us bury our feuds, as was proposed, by the\n",
      "intermarriage of our children. But trust me, it ill becomes a Prince of\n",
      "your bearing to practise on mercenary wenches.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I scorn your imputation,” said Frederic. “Until this hour I never set\n",
      "eyes on this damsel: I have given her no jewel. My Lord, my Lord, your\n",
      "conscience, your guilt accuses you, and would throw the suspicion on me;\n",
      "but keep your daughter, and think no more of Isabella. The judgments\n",
      "already fallen on your house forbid me matching into it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, alarmed at the resolute tone in which Frederic delivered these\n",
      "words, endeavoured to pacify him. Dismissing Bianca, he made such\n",
      "submissions to the Marquis, and threw in such artful encomiums on\n",
      "Matilda, that Frederic was once more staggered. However, as his passion\n",
      "was of so recent a date, it could not at once surmount the scruples he\n",
      "had conceived. He had gathered enough from Bianca’s discourse to\n",
      "persuade him that heaven declared itself against Manfred. The proposed\n",
      "marriages too removed his claim to a distance; and the principality of\n",
      "Otranto was a stronger temptation than the contingent reversion of it\n",
      "with Matilda. Still he would not absolutely recede from his engagements;\n",
      "but purposing to gain time, he demanded of Manfred if it was true in fact\n",
      "that Hippolita consented to the divorce. The Prince, transported to find\n",
      "no other obstacle, and depending on his influence over his wife, assured\n",
      "the Marquis it was so, and that he might satisfy himself of the truth\n",
      "from her own mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they were thus discoursing, word was brought that the banquet was\n",
      "prepared. Manfred conducted Frederic to the great hall, where they were\n",
      "received by Hippolita and the young Princesses. Manfred placed the\n",
      "Marquis next to Matilda, and seated himself between his wife and\n",
      "Isabella. Hippolita comported herself with an easy gravity; but the\n",
      "young ladies were silent and melancholy. Manfred, who was determined to\n",
      "pursue his point with the Marquis in the remainder of the evening, pushed\n",
      "on the feast until it waxed late; affecting unrestrained gaiety, and\n",
      "plying Frederic with repeated goblets of wine. The latter, more upon his\n",
      "guard than Manfred wished, declined his frequent challenges, on pretence\n",
      "of his late loss of blood; while the Prince, to raise his own disordered\n",
      "spirits, and to counterfeit unconcern, indulged himself in plentiful\n",
      "draughts, though not to the intoxication of his senses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening being far advanced, the banquet concluded. Manfred would\n",
      "have withdrawn with Frederic; but the latter pleading weakness and want\n",
      "of repose, retired to his chamber, gallantly telling the Prince that his\n",
      "daughter should amuse his Highness until himself could attend him.\n",
      "Manfred accepted the party, and to the no small grief of Isabella,\n",
      "accompanied her to her apartment. Matilda waited on her mother to enjoy\n",
      "the freshness of the evening on the ramparts of the castle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon as the company were dispersed their several ways, Frederic, quitting\n",
      "his chamber, inquired if Hippolita was alone, and was told by one of her\n",
      "attendants, who had not noticed her going forth, that at that hour she\n",
      "generally withdrew to her oratory, where he probably would find her. The\n",
      "Marquis, during the repast, had beheld Matilda with increase of passion.\n",
      "He now wished to find Hippolita in the disposition her Lord had promised.\n",
      "The portents that had alarmed him were forgotten in his desires.\n",
      "Stealing softly and unobserved to the apartment of Hippolita, he entered\n",
      "it with a resolution to encourage her acquiescence to the divorce, having\n",
      "perceived that Manfred was resolved to make the possession of Isabella an\n",
      "unalterable condition, before he would grant Matilda to his wishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Marquis was not surprised at the silence that reigned in the\n",
      "Princess’s apartment. Concluding her, as he had been advertised, in her\n",
      "oratory, he passed on. The door was ajar; the evening gloomy and\n",
      "overcast. Pushing open the door gently, he saw a person kneeling before\n",
      "the altar. As he approached nearer, it seemed not a woman, but one in a\n",
      "long woollen weed, whose back was towards him. The person seemed\n",
      "absorbed in prayer. The Marquis was about to return, when the figure,\n",
      "rising, stood some moments fixed in meditation, without regarding him.\n",
      "The Marquis, expecting the holy person to come forth, and meaning to\n",
      "excuse his uncivil interruption, said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Reverend Father, I sought the Lady Hippolita.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hippolita!” replied a hollow voice; “camest thou to this castle to seek\n",
      "Hippolita?” and then the figure, turning slowly round, discovered to\n",
      "Frederic the fleshless jaws and empty sockets of a skeleton, wrapt in a\n",
      "hermit’s cowl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Angels of grace protect me!” cried Frederic, recoiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Deserve their protection!” said the Spectre. Frederic, falling on his\n",
      "knees, adjured the phantom to take pity on him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dost thou not remember me?” said the apparition. “Remember the wood of\n",
      "Joppa!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Art thou that holy hermit?” cried Frederic, trembling. “Can I do aught\n",
      "for thy eternal peace?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wast thou delivered from bondage,” said the spectre, “to pursue carnal\n",
      "delights? Hast thou forgotten the buried sabre, and the behest of Heaven\n",
      "engraven on it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have not, I have not,” said Frederic; “but say, blest spirit, what is\n",
      "thy errand to me? What remains to be done?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To forget Matilda!” said the apparition; and vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frederic’s blood froze in his veins. For some minutes he remained\n",
      "motionless. Then falling prostrate on his face before the altar, he\n",
      "besought the intercession of every saint for pardon. A flood of tears\n",
      "succeeded to this transport; and the image of the beauteous Matilda\n",
      "rushing in spite of him on his thoughts, he lay on the ground in a\n",
      "conflict of penitence and passion. Ere he could recover from this agony\n",
      "of his spirits, the Princess Hippolita with a taper in her hand entered\n",
      "the oratory alone. Seeing a man without motion on the floor, she gave a\n",
      "shriek, concluding him dead. Her fright brought Frederic to himself.\n",
      "Rising suddenly, his face bedewed with tears, he would have rushed from\n",
      "her presence; but Hippolita stopping him, conjured him in the most\n",
      "plaintive accents to explain the cause of his disorder, and by what\n",
      "strange chance she had found him there in that posture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, virtuous Princess!” said the Marquis, penetrated with grief, and\n",
      "stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For the love of Heaven, my Lord,” said Hippolita, “disclose the cause of\n",
      "this transport! What mean these doleful sounds, this alarming\n",
      "exclamation on my name? What woes has heaven still in store for the\n",
      "wretched Hippolita? Yet silent! By every pitying angel, I adjure thee,\n",
      "noble Prince,” continued she, falling at his feet, “to disclose the\n",
      "purport of what lies at thy heart. I see thou feelest for me; thou\n",
      "feelest the sharp pangs that thou inflictest—speak, for pity! Does aught\n",
      "thou knowest concern my child?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I cannot speak,” cried Frederic, bursting from her. “Oh, Matilda!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Quitting the Princess thus abruptly, he hastened to his own apartment.\n",
      "At the door of it he was accosted by Manfred, who flushed by wine and\n",
      "love had come to seek him, and to propose to waste some hours of the\n",
      "night in music and revelling. Frederic, offended at an invitation so\n",
      "dissonant from the mood of his soul, pushed him rudely aside, and\n",
      "entering his chamber, flung the door intemperately against Manfred, and\n",
      "bolted it inwards. The haughty Prince, enraged at this unaccountable\n",
      "behaviour, withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the most fatal\n",
      "excesses. As he crossed the court, he was met by the domestic whom he\n",
      "had planted at the convent as a spy on Jerome and Theodore. This man,\n",
      "almost breathless with the haste he had made, informed his Lord that\n",
      "Theodore, and some lady from the castle were, at that instant, in private\n",
      "conference at the tomb of Alfonso in St. Nicholas’s church. He had\n",
      "dogged Theodore thither, but the gloominess of the night had prevented\n",
      "his discovering who the woman was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, whose spirits were inflamed, and whom Isabella had driven from\n",
      "her on his urging his passion with too little reserve, did not doubt but\n",
      "the inquietude she had expressed had been occasioned by her impatience to\n",
      "meet Theodore. Provoked by this conjecture, and enraged at her father,\n",
      "he hastened secretly to the great church. Gliding softly between the\n",
      "aisles, and guided by an imperfect gleam of moonshine that shone faintly\n",
      "through the illuminated windows, he stole towards the tomb of Alfonso, to\n",
      "which he was directed by indistinct whispers of the persons he sought.\n",
      "The first sounds he could distinguish were—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does it, alas! depend on me? Manfred will never permit our union.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, this shall prevent it!” cried the tyrant, drawing his dagger, and\n",
      "plunging it over her shoulder into the bosom of the person that spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ah, me, I am slain!” cried Matilda, sinking. “Good heaven, receive my\n",
      "soul!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Savage, inhuman monster, what hast thou done!” cried Theodore, rushing\n",
      "on him, and wrenching his dagger from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop, stop thy impious hand!” cried Matilda; “it is my father!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Manfred, waking as from a trance, beat his breast, twisted his hands in\n",
      "his locks, and endeavoured to recover his dagger from Theodore to\n",
      "despatch himself. Theodore, scarce less distracted, and only mastering\n",
      "the transports of his grief to assist Matilda, had now by his cries drawn\n",
      "some of the monks to his aid. While part of them endeavoured, in concert\n",
      "with the afflicted Theodore, to stop the blood of the dying Princess, the\n",
      "rest prevented Manfred from laying violent hands on himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matilda, resigning herself patiently to her fate, acknowledged with looks\n",
      "of grateful love the zeal of Theodore. Yet oft as her faintness would\n",
      "permit her speech its way, she begged the assistants to comfort her\n",
      "father. Jerome, by this time, had learnt the fatal news, and reached the\n",
      "church. His looks seemed to reproach Theodore, but turning to Manfred,\n",
      "he said,\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, tyrant! behold the completion of woe fulfilled on thy impious and\n",
      "devoted head! The blood of Alfonso cried to heaven for vengeance; and\n",
      "heaven has permitted its altar to be polluted by assassination, that thou\n",
      "mightest shed thy own blood at the foot of that Prince’s sepulchre!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Cruel man!” cried Matilda, “to aggravate the woes of a parent; may\n",
      "heaven bless my father, and forgive him as I do! My Lord, my gracious\n",
      "Sire, dost thou forgive thy child? Indeed, I came not hither to meet\n",
      "Theodore. I found him praying at this tomb, whither my mother sent me to\n",
      "intercede for thee, for her—dearest father, bless your child, and say you\n",
      "forgive her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Forgive thee! Murderous monster!” cried Manfred, “can assassins\n",
      "forgive? I took thee for Isabella; but heaven directed my bloody hand to\n",
      "the heart of my child. Oh, Matilda!—I cannot utter it—canst thou forgive\n",
      "the blindness of my rage?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can, I do; and may heaven confirm it!” said Matilda; “but while I have\n",
      "life to ask it—oh! my mother! what will she feel? Will you comfort her,\n",
      "my Lord? Will you not put her away? Indeed she loves you! Oh, I am\n",
      "faint! bear me to the castle. Can I live to have her close my eyes?”\n",

      "Isabella and her women tore Hippolita from the corse; but Theodore\n",
      "threatened destruction to all who attempted to remove him from it. He\n",
      "printed a thousand kisses on her clay-cold hands, and uttered every\n",
      "expression that despairing love could dictate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isabella, in the meantime, was accompanying the afflicted Hippolita to\n",
      "her apartment; but, in the middle of the court, they were met by Manfred,\n",
      "who, distracted with his own thoughts, and anxious once more to behold\n",
      "his daughter, was advancing to the chamber where she lay. As the moon\n",
      "was now at its height, he read in the countenances of this unhappy\n",
      "company the event he dreaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What! is she dead?” cried he in wild confusion. A clap of thunder at\n",
      "that instant shook the castle to its foundations; the earth rocked, and\n",
      "the clank of more than mortal armour was heard behind. Frederic and\n",
      "Jerome thought the last day was at hand. The latter, forcing Theodore\n",
      "along with them, rushed into the court. The moment Theodore appeared,\n",
      "the walls of the castle behind Manfred were thrown down with a mighty\n",
      "force, and the form of Alfonso, dilated to an immense magnitude, appeared\n",
      "in the centre of the ruins.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Behold in Theodore the true heir of Alfonso!” said the vision: And\n",
      "having pronounced those words, accompanied by a clap of thunder, it\n",
      "ascended solemnly towards heaven, where the clouds parting asunder, the\n",
      "form of St. Nicholas was seen, and receiving Alfonso’s shade, they were\n",
      "soon wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "The beholders fell prostrate on their faces, acknowledging the divine\n",

      "human greatness! Conrad is gone! Matilda is no more! In Theodore we\n",
      "view the true Prince of Otranto. By what miracle he is so I know\n",
      "not—suffice it to us, our doom is pronounced! shall we not, can we but\n",
      "dedicate the few deplorable hours we have to live, in deprecating the\n",
      "further wrath of heaven? heaven ejects us—whither can we fly, but to yon\n",
      "holy cells that yet offer us a retreat.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Manfred, “my heart at last is open to thy devout admonitions. Oh!\n",
      "could—but it cannot be—ye are lost in wonder—let me at last do justice on\n",
      "myself! To heap shame on my own head is all the satisfaction I have left\n",
      "to offer to offended heaven. My story has drawn down these judgments:\n",
      "Let my confession atone—but, ah! what can atone for usurpation and a\n",
      "murdered child? a child murdered in a consecrated place? List, sirs, and\n",
      "may this bloody record be a warning to future tyrants!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Alfonso, ye all know, died in the Holy Land—ye would interrupt me; ye\n",
      "would say he came not fairly to his end—it is most true—why else this\n",
      "bitter cup which Manfred must drink to the dregs. Ricardo, my\n",
      "grandfather, was his chamberlain—I would draw a veil over my ancestor’s\n",
      "crimes—but it is in vain! Alfonso died by poison. A fictitious will\n",
      "declared Ricardo his heir. His crimes pursued him—yet he lost no Conrad,\n",
      "no Matilda! I pay the price of usurpation for all! A storm overtook\n",
      "him. Haunted by his guilt he vowed to St. Nicholas to found a church and\n",
      "two convents, if he lived to reach Otranto. The sacrifice was accepted:\n",
      "the saint appeared to him in a dream, and promised that Ricardo’s\n",
      "posterity should reign in Otranto until the rightful owner should be\n",
      "grown too large to inhabit the castle, and as long as issue male from\n",
      "Ricardo’s loins should remain to enjoy it—alas! alas! nor male nor\n",
      "female, except myself, remains of all his wretched race! I have done—the\n",
      "woes of these three days speak the rest. How this young man can be\n",
      "Alfonso’s heir I know not—yet I do not doubt it. His are these\n",
      "dominions; I resign them—yet I knew not Alfonso had an heir—I question\n",
      "not the will of heaven—poverty and prayer must fill up the woeful space,\n",
      "until Manfred shall be summoned to Ricardo.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What remains is my part to declare,” said Jerome. “When Alfonso set\n",
      "sail for the Holy Land he was driven by a storm to the coast of Sicily.\n",
      "The other vessel, which bore Ricardo and his train, as your Lordship must\n",
      "have heard, was separated from him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is most true,” said Manfred; “and the title you give me is more than\n",
      "an outcast can claim—well! be it so—proceed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerome blushed, and continued. “For three months Lord Alfonso was\n",
      "wind-bound in Sicily. There he became enamoured of a fair virgin named\n",
      "Victoria. He was too pious to tempt her to forbidden pleasures. They\n",
      "were married. Yet deeming this amour incongruous with the holy vow of\n",
      "arms by which he was bound, he determined to conceal their nuptials until\n",
      "his return from the Crusade, when he purposed to seek and acknowledge her\n",
      "for his lawful wife. He left her pregnant. During his absence she was\n",
      "delivered of a daughter. But scarce had she felt a mother’s pangs ere\n",
      "she heard the fatal rumour of her Lord’s death, and the succession of\n",
      "Ricardo. What could a friendless, helpless woman do? Would her\n",
      "testimony avail?—yet, my lord, I have an authentic writing—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It needs not,” said Manfred; “the horrors of these days, the vision we\n",
      "have but now seen, all corroborate thy evidence beyond a thousand\n",
      "parchments. Matilda’s death and my expulsion—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be composed, my Lord,” said Hippolita; “this holy man did not mean to\n",
      "recall your griefs.” Jerome proceeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall not dwell on what is needless. The daughter of which Victoria\n",
      "was delivered, was at her maturity bestowed in marriage on me. Victoria\n",
      "died; and the secret remained locked in my breast. Theodore’s narrative\n",
      "has told the rest.”\n",

      "The Friar ceased. The disconsolate company retired to the remaining part\n",
      "of the castle. In the morning Manfred signed his abdication of the\n",
      "principality, with the approbation of Hippolita, and each took on them\n",
      "the habit of religion in the neighbouring convents. Frederic offered his\n",
      "daughter to the new Prince, which Hippolita’s tenderness for Isabella\n",
      "concurred to promote. But Theodore’s grief was too fresh to admit the\n",
