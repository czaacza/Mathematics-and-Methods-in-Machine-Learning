       " 'My father, who had received a maim on his limbs, that disabled him from\\nfollowing the more laborious branches of country drudgery, got, by\\nmaking nets, a scanty subsistence, which was not much enlarged by my\\nmother’s keeping a little day-school for the girls in her neighborhood.',\n",
       " 'They had had several children; but none lived to any age except myself,\\nwho had received from nature a constitution perfectly healthy.',\n",
       " 'My education, till past fourteen, was no better than very vulgar:\\nreading, or rather spelling, an illegible scrawl, and a little ordinary\\nplain work, composed the whole system of it; and then all my foundation\\nin virtue was no other than a total ignorance of vice, and the shy\\ntimidity general to our sex, in the tender age of life, when objects\\nalarm or frighten more by their novelty than anything else.',\n",
       " 'But then,\\nthis is a fear too often cured at the expense of innocence, when Miss,\\nby degrees, begins no longer to look on a man as a creature of prey\\nthat will eat her.',\n",
       " 'My poor mother had divided her time so entirely between her scholars\\nand her little domestic cares, that she had spared very little to my\\ninstruction, having, from her own innocence from all ill, no hint or\\nthought of guarding me against any.',\n",
       " 'I was now entering on my fifteenth year, when the worst of ills befell\\nme in the loss of my fond, tender parents, who were both carried off by\\nthe small-pox, within a few days of each other; my father dying first,\\nand thereby by hastening the death of my mother: so that I was now left\\nan unhappy friendless orphan (for my father’s coming to settle there,\\nwas accidental, he being originally a Kentisrman).',\n",
       " 'That cruel distemper\\nwhich had proved so fatal to them, had indeed seized me, but with such\\nmild and favourable symptoms, that I was presently out of danger, and\\nwhat then I did not know the value of, was entirely unmarked I skip\\nover here an account of the natural grief and affliction which I felt\\non this melancholy occasion.',\n",
       " 'A little time, and the giddiness of that\\nage, dissipated too soon my reflections on that irreparable loss; but\\nnothing contributed more to reconcile me to it, than the notions that\\nwere immediately put into my head, of going to London, and looking out\\nfor a service, in which I was promised all assistance and advice from\\none Esther Davis, a young woman that had beer down to see her friends,\\nand who, after the stay of a few days, was returned to her place.',\n",
       " 'As I had now nobody left alive in the village, who had concern enough\\nabout what should become of me, to start any objections to this scheme,\\nand the woman who took care of me after my parents’ death, rather\\nencouraged me to pursue it, I soon came to a resolution of making this\\nlaunch into the wide world, by repairing to London, in order to seek my\\nfortune, a phrase which, by the bye, has ruined more adventurers of\\nboth sexes, from the country, than ever it made or advanced.',\n",
       " 'Nor did Esther Davis a little comfort and inspirit me to venture with\\nher, by piquing my childish curiosity with the fine sights that were to\\nbe seen in London: the Tombs, the Lions, the King, the Royal Family,\\nthe fine Plays and Operas, and, in short, all the diversions which fell\\nwithin her sphere of life to come at; the detail of all which perfectly\\nturned the little head of me.',\n",
       " 'Nor can I remember, without laughing, the innocent admiration, not\\nwithout a spice of envy, with which we poor girls, whose church-going\\nclothes did not rise above dowlas shifts and stuff gowns, beplaced with\\nsilver: all which we imagined grew in London, and entered for a great\\ndeal into my determination of trying to come in for my share of them.',\n",
       " 'The idea however of having the company of a towns-woman with her, was\\nthe trivial, and all the motives that engaged Esther to take charge of\\nme during my journey to town, where she told me, after the manner and\\nstyle, “as how several maids out of the country had made themselves and\\nall their kind for ever: that by preserving their virtue, some had\\ntaken so with their masters, that they had married them, and kept them\\ncoaches, and lived vastly grand and happy; and some, may-hap, came to\\nbe Duchesses; luck was all, and why not I, as well as another?”; with\\nother almanacs to this purpose, which set me a tip-toe to begin this\\npromising journey, and to leave a place which, though my native one,\\ncontained no relations that I had reason to regret, and was grown\\ninsupportable to me, from the change of the tenderest usage into a cold\\nair of charity, with which I was entertained, even at the only friend’s\\nhouse that I had the least expectation of care and protection from.',\n",
       " 'She\\nwas, however, so just to me, as to manage the turning into money the\\nlittle matters that remained to me after the debts and burial charges\\nwere allowed for, and, at my departure, put my whole fortune into my\\nhands; which consisted of a very slender wardrobe, packed up in a very\\nportable box, and eight guineas, with seventeen shillings in silver,\\nstowed in a spring-pouch, which was a greater treasure than I ever had\\nseen together, and which I could not conceive there was a possibility\\nof running out; and indeed, I was so entirely taken up with the joy of\\nseeing myself mistress of such an immence sum, that I gave very little\\nattention to a world of good advice which was given me with it.',\n",
       " 'Places, then, being taken for Esther and me in the Chester waggon, I\\npass over a very immaterial scene of leave-taking, at which I droped a\\nfew tears betwixt grief and joy; and, for the same reasons of\\ninsignificance, skip over all that happened to me on the road, such as\\nthe waggoner’s looking liquorish on me, the schemes laid for me by some\\nof the passengers, which were defeated by the valiance of my guardian\\nEsther; who, to do her justice, took a motherly care of me, at the same\\ntime that she taxed me for the protection by making me bear all\\ntravelling charges, which I defrayed with the unmost cheerfulness, and\\nthought myself much obliged to her into the bargain.',\n",
       " 'She took indeed great care that we were not overrated, or imposed on,\\nas well as of managing as frugally as possible; expensiveness was not\\nher vice.',\n",
       " 'It was pretty late in a summer evening when we reached the town, in our\\nslow conveyance, though drawn by six at length.',\n",
       " 'As we passed through\\nthe greatest streets that led to our inn, the noise, of the coaches,\\nthe hurry, the crowds of foot passengers, in short, the new scenery of\\nthe shops and houses, at once pleased and amazed me.',\n",
       " 'But guess at my mortification and surprise when we came to the inn, and\\nour things were landed and delivered to us, when my fellow traveller\\nand protectress, Esther Davis, who had used me with the utmost\\ntenderness during the journey, and prepared me by no preceedings signs\\nfor the stunning blow I was to receive, when I say, my only dependence\\nand friend, in this strange place, all of a sudden assumed a strange\\nand cool air towards me, as if she dreaded my becoming a burden to her.',\n",
       " 'Instead, then, of proffering me the continuance of her assistance and\\ngood offices, which I relied upon, and never more wanted, she thought\\nherself, it seems, abundantly acquitted of her engagements to me, by\\nhaving brought me safe to my journey’s end, and seeing nothing in her\\nprocedure towards me but what natural and in order, began to embrace me\\nby the way of taking leave, whilst I was so confounded, so struck, that\\nI had not spirit or sense enough so much as to mention my hopes or\\nexpectations from her experience, and knowledge of the place she had\\nbrought me to.',\n",
       " 'Whilst I stood thus stupid and mute, which she doubtless attributed to\\nnothing more than a concern at parting, this idea procured me perhaps a\\nslight alleviation of it, in the following harangue: “That now we were\\ngot safe to London, and that she was obliged to go to her place, she\\nadvised me by all means to get into one as soon as possible; that I\\nneed not fear getting one; there were more places than parish-churches;\\nthat she advised me to go to an intelligence office; that if she heard\\nof any thing stirring, she would find me out and let me know; that in\\nthe meantime, I should take a private lodging, and acquaint her where\\nto send to me; that she wished me good luck, and hoped I should always\\nhave the grace to keep myself honest, and not bringing a disgrace on my\\nparentage.” With this; she took her leave of me, and left me, as it\\nwere, on my own hands, full as lightly as I had been put into hers.',\n",
       " 'Left thus alone, absolutely destitute and friendless I began then to\\nfeel most bitterly the severity of this separation, the scene of which\\nhad passed in a little room in the inn; and no sooner was her back\\nturned, but the affliction I felt at my helpless strange circumstances,\\nburst out into a flood of tears, which infinitely relieved the\\noppression of my heart; though I still remained stupified, and most\\nperfectly perplexed how to dispose of myself.',\n",
       " 'One of the drawers coming in, added yet more to my uncertainty, by\\nasking me, in a short way, if I called for anything?',\n",
       " 'to which I replied\\ninnocently: “No.” But I wished him to tell me where I might get a\\nlodging for that night.',\n",
       " 'He said he would go and speak to his mistress,\\nwho accordingly came, and told me drily, without entering in the least\\ninto the distress she saw me in, that I might have a bed for a\\nshilling, and that, as she supposed I had some friends in town (there I\\nfetched a deep sigh in vain!',\n",
       " '), I might provide for myself in the\\nmorning.',\n",
       " 'It is incredible what trifling consolations the human mind will seize\\nin its greatest afflictions.',\n",
       " 'The assurance of nothing more than a bed\\nto lie on that night, calmed my agonies; and being ashamed to acquaint\\nthe mistress of the inn that I had no friends to apply to in town, I\\nproposed to myself to proceed, the very next morning, to an\\nintelligence office, to which I was furnished with written directions\\non the back of a ballad, Esther had given me.',\n",
       " 'There I counted on\\ngetting information of any place that such a country girl as I might be\\nfit for, and where I could get into any sort of being, before my little\\nstock should be consumed; and as to a character, Esther had often\\nrepeated to me, that I might depend on her managing me one; nor,\\nhowever affected I was at her leaving me thus, did I entirely cease to\\nrely on her, as I began to think, good-naturedly, that her procedure\\nwas all in course, and that is was only my ignorance of life that had\\nmade me take it in the light I at first did.',\n",
       " 'Accordingly, the next morning I dressed myself as clean and as neat as\\nmy rustic wardrobe would permit me; and having left my box, with\\nspecial recommendation, with the landlady, I ventured out by myself,\\nand without any more difficulty than can be supposed of a young country\\ngirl, barely fifteen, and to whom every sign or shop was a gazing trap,\\nI got to the wished for intelligence office.',\n",
       " 'It was kept by an elderly woman, who sat at the receipt of custom, with\\na book before her in great form and order, and several scrolls made\\nout, of directions for places.',\n",
       " 'I made up then to this important personage, without lifting up my eyes\\nor observing any of the people round me, who were attending there on\\nthe same errand as myself, and dropping her curtsies nine deep, just\\nmade a shift to stammer out my business to her.',\n",
       " 'Madam heard me out, with all the gravity and brow of a petty minister\\nof State, and seeing at one glance over my figure what I was, made me\\nno answer, but to ask me the preliminary shilling, on receipt of which\\nshe told me places for women too slight built for hard work: but that\\nshe would look over her book, and see what was to be done for me,\\ndesiring me to stay a little, till she had dispatched some other\\ncustomers.',\n",
       " 'On this I drew back a little, most heartily mortified at a declaration\\nwhich carried with it a killing uncertainly, that my circumstances\\ncould not well endure.',\n",
       " 'Presently, assuming more courage, and seeking some diversion from my\\nuneasy thoughts, I ventured to lift up my head a little, and sent my\\neyes on a course round the room, where they met full tilt with those of\\na lady (for such my extreme innocence pronounced her) sitting in a\\ncorner of the room, dressed in a velvet mantle (in the midst of\\nsummer), with her bonnet off; squat, fat, red-faced, and at least\\nfifty.',\n",
       " 'She looked as if she would devour me with her eyes, staring at me from\\nhead to foot, without the least regard to the confusion and blushes her\\neyeing me so fixedly put me to, and which were to her, no doubt, the\\nstrongest recommendation and marks of my being fit for her purpose.',\n",
       " 'After a little time, in which my air, person and whole figure had\\nundergone a strict examination, which I had, on my part, tried to\\nrender favourable to me, by primming, drawing up my neck, and setting\\nmy best looks, she advanced and spoke to me with the greatest\\ndemureness:\\n\\n“Sweet-heart, do you want a place?',\n",
       " '“Yes, and please you,” (with a curtsey down to the ground).',\n",
       " 'Upon this she acquainted me she was actually come to the office\\nherself, to look out for a servant; that she believed I might do, with\\na little of her instruction; that she could take my very looks for a\\nsufficient character; that London was a very wicked, vile, place; that\\nshe hoped I would be tractable, and keep out of bad company; in short,\\nshe said all to me that an old experienced practitioner in town could\\nthink of, and which was much more than was necessary to take in an\\nartless inexperienced country maid, who was even afraid of becoming a\\nwanderer about the streets, and therefore gladly jumped at the first\\noffer of a shelter, especially from so grave and matron-like a lady,\\nfor such my flattering fancy assured me this new mistress of mine was,\\nI being actually hired under the nose of the good woman that kept the\\noffice, whose shrewed smiles and shrugs I could not help observing, and\\ninnocently interpreted them as marks of being pleased at my getting\\ninto place so soon: but, as I afterwards came to know, these Beldams\\nunderstood one another very well, and this was a market where Mrs.\\nBrown, my mistress, frequently attended, on the watch for any fresh\\ngoods that might offer there, for the use of her customers, and her own\\nprofit.',\n",
       " 'Madam was, however, so well pleased with her bargain that fearing I\\npresume, lest better advice or some accident might occasion my slipping\\nthrough her fingers, she would officiously take me in a coach to my\\ninn, where, calling herself for my box, it was, I being present,\\ndelivered without the least scruple or explanation as to where I was\\ngoing.',\n",
       " 'This being over, she bid the coachman drive to a shop in St. Paul’s\\nChurchyard, where she bought a pair of gloves, which she gave me, and\\nthence renewed her directions to the coachman to drive to her house in\\n——— street, who accordingly landed us at the door, after I had been\\ncheered up and entertained by the way with the most plausible flams,\\nwithout one syllable from which I could conclude anything but that I\\nwas, by the greatest luck, fallen into the hands of kindest mistress,\\nnot to say friend, that the vast world could afford; and accordingly I\\nentered her doors with most complete confidence and exultation,\\npromising, myself that, as soon as I could be a little settled, I would\\nacquaint Esther Davis with my rare good fortune.',\n",
       " 'You may be sure the good opinion of my place was not lessened by the\\nappearance of a very handsome back parlor, into which I was led and\\nwhich seemed to me magnificently furnished, who had never seen better\\nrooms than the ordinary ones in inns upon the road.',\n",
       " 'There were two gilt\\npier-glasses, and a buffet, on which a few pieces of plate, set out to\\nthe most shew, dazzled, and altogether persuaded me that I must be got\\ninto a very reputable family.',\n",
       " 'Here my mistress first began her part, with telling me that I must have\\ngood spirits, and learn to be free with her; that she had not taken me\\nto be a common servant, to do domestic drudgery, but to be a kind of\\ncompanion to her; and that if I would be a good girl, she would do more\\nthan twenty mothers for me; to all which I answered only by the\\nprofoundest and the awkwardest curtsies, and a few monosyllables, such\\nas “’yes!',\n",
       " 'no!',\n",
       " 'to be sure!”\\n\\nPresently my mistress touched the bell, and in came a strapping\\nmaid-servant, who had let us in.',\n",
       " '“Here, Martha,” said Mrs. Brown, “I\\nhave just hired this young woman to look after my linen; so step up and\\nshow her her chamber; and I charge you to use her with as much respect\\nas you would myself, for I have taken a prodigious liking to her, and I\\ndo not know what I shall do for her.”\\n\\nMartha, who was an arch-jade, and, being used to this decoy, had her\\ncue perfect, made me a kind of half curtsy, and asked me to walk up\\nwith her; and accordingly showed me a neat room, two pair of stairs\\nbackwards, in which there was a handsome bed, where Martha told me I\\nwas to lie with a young gentlewoman, a cousin of my mistress, who she\\nwas sure would be vastly good to me.',\n",
       " 'Then she ran out into such\\naffected encomiums on her good mistress!',\n",
       " 'her sweet mistress!',\n",
       " 'and how\\nhappy I was to light upon her!',\n",
       " 'and that I could not have bespoke a\\nbetter; with other the like gross stuff, such as would itself have\\nstarted suspicions in any but such an unpractised simpleton, who was\\nperfectly new to life, and who took every word she said in the very\\nsense she laid out for me to take it; but she readily saw what a\\npenetration she had to deal with, and measured me very rightly in her\\nmanner of whistling to me, so as to make me pleased with my cage, and\\nblind to the wires.',\n",
       " 'In the midst of these false explanations of the nature of my future\\nservice, we were rung for down again, and I was reintroduced into the\\nsame parlour, where there was a table laid with three covers; and my\\nmistress had now got with her one of her favourite girls, a notable\\nmanager of her house, and whose business it was to prepare and break\\nsuch young fillies as I was to the mounting block; and she was\\naccordingly, in that view, alloted me for a bed-fellow, and, to give\\nher the more authority, she had the title of cousin conferred on her by\\nthe venerable president of this college.',\n",
       " 'Here I underwent a second survey, which ended in the full approbation\\nof Mrs. Phœbe Ayres, the name of my tutoress elect, to whose care and\\ninstruction I was affectionately recommended.',\n",
       " 'Dinner was now set on table, and in pursuance of treating me as a\\ncompanion, Mrs. Brown, with a tone to cut off all dispute, soon\\nover-ruled my most humble and most confused protestations against\\nsitting down with her Ladyship, which my very short breeding just\\nsuggested to me could not be right, or in the order of things.',\n",
       " 'At table, the conversation was chiefly kept up by the two madams and\\ncarried on in double meaning expressions, interrupted every now and\\nthen by kind assurances to me, all tending to confirm and fix my\\nsatisfaction with my present condition: augment it they could not, so\\nvery a novice was I then.',\n",
       " 'It was here agreed that I should keep myself up and out of sight for a\\nfew days, till such clothes could be procured for me as were fit for\\nthe character I was to appear in, of my mistress’s companion, observing\\nwithal, that on the first impressions of my figure much might depend;\\nand, as they rightly judged, the prospect of exchanging my country\\nclothes for London finery, made the clause of confinement digest\\nperfectly well with me.',\n",
       " 'But the truth was, Mrs. Brown did not care that\\nI should be seen or talked to by any, either of her customers, or her\\nDoes (as they called the girls provided for them), till she secured a\\ngood market for my maidenhead, which I had at least all the appearances\\nof having brought into her Ladyship’s service.',\n",
       " 'To slip over minutes of no importance to the main of my story, I pass\\nthe interval to bed time, in which I was more and more pleased with the\\nviews that opened to me, of an easy service under these good people;\\nand after supper being shewed up to bed, Miss Phœbe, who observed a\\nkind of reluctance in me to strip and go to bed, in my shift, before\\nher, now the maid was withdrawn, came up to me, and beginning with\\nunpinning my handkerchief and gown, soon encouraged me to go on with\\nundressing myself; and, blushing at now seeing myself naked to my\\nshift, I hurried to get under the bed-clothes out of sight.',\n",
       " 'Phœbe laughed and was not long before she placed herself by my side.',\n",
       " 'She was about five and twenty, by her most suspicious account, in\\nwhich, according to all appearances, she must have sunk at least ten\\ngood years; allowance, too, being made for the havoc which a long\\ncourse of hackneyship and hot waters must have made of her\\nconstitution, and which had already brought on, upon the spur, that\\nstale stage in which those of her profession are reduced to think of\\nshowing company, instead of seeing it.',\n",
       " 'No sooner then was this precious substitute of my mistress laid down,\\nbut she, who was never out of her way when any occasion of lewdness\\npresented itself, turned to me, embraced and kissed me with great\\neagerness.',\n",
       " 'This was new, this was odd; but imputing it to nothing but\\npure kindness, which, for ought I knew, it might be the London way to\\nexpress in that manner, I was determined not to be behind-hand with\\nher, and returned her the kiss and embrace, with all the fervour that\\nperfect innocence knew.',\n",
       " 'Encouraged by this, her hands became extremely free, and wandered over\\nmy whole body, with touches, squeezes, pressures, that rather warmed\\nand surprised me with their novelty, than they either shocked or\\nalarmed me.',\n",
       " 'The flattering praises she intermingled with these invasions,\\ncontributed also not a little to bribe my passiveness; and, knowing no\\nill, I feared none, especially from one who had prevented all doubts of\\nher womanhood, by conducting my hands to a pair of breasts that hung\\nloosely down, in a size and volume that full sufficiently distinguished\\nher sex, to me at least, who had never made any other comparison.',\n",
       " 'I lay then all tame and passive as she could wish, whilst her freedom\\nraised no other emotion but those of a strange, and, till then, unfelt\\npleasure.',\n",
       " 'Every part of me was open and exposed to the licentious\\ncourses of her hands, which, like a lambent fire, ran over my whole\\nbody, and thawed all coldness as they went.',\n",
       " 'My breasts, if it is not too bold a figure to call so two hard, firm,\\nrising hillocks, that just began to shew themselves, or signify\\nanything to the touch, employed and amused her hands awhile, till,\\nslipping down lower, over a smooth track, she could just feel the soft\\nsilky down that had but a few months before put forth and garnished the\\nmount-pleasant of those parts, and promised to spread a grateful\\nshelter over the sweet seat of the most exquisite sensation, and which\\nhad been, till that instant, the seat of the most insensible innocence.',\n",
       " 'Her fingers played and strove to twine in the young tendrils of that\\nmoss, which nature has contrived at once for use and ornament.',\n",
       " 'But, not contented with these outer posts, she now attempts the main\\nspot, and began to twitch, to insinuate, and at length to force an\\nintroduction of a finger into the quick itself, in such a manner, that\\nhad she not proceeded by insensible gradations that inflamed me beyond\\nthe power of modesty to oppose its resistance to their progress, I\\nshould have jumped out of bed and cried for help against such strange\\nassaults.',\n",
       " 'Instead of which, her lascivious touches had lighted up a new fire that\\nwantoned through all my veins, but fixed with violence in that center\\nappointed them by nature, where the first strange hands were now busied\\nin feeling, squeezing, compressing the lips, then opening them again,\\nwith a finger between, till an “Oh!” expressed her hurting me, where\\nthe narrowness of the unbroken passage refused it entrance to any\\ndepth.',\n",
       " 'In the meantime, the extension of my limbs, languid stretching, sighs,\\nshort heavings, all conspired to assure that experienced wanton that I\\nwas more pleased than offended at her proceedings, which she seasoned\\nwith repeated kisses and exclamations, such as “Oh!',\n",
       " 'what a charming\\ncreature thou art!',\n",
       " 'What a happy man will he be that first makes a woman\\nof you!',\n",

       " 'Phœbe, herself, the hackneyed, thorough-bred Phœbe, to whom all modes\\nand devices of pleasure were known and familiar, found, it seems, in\\nthis exercise her those arbitrary tastes, for which there is no\\naccounting.',\n",
       " 'Not that she hated men, or did not even prefer them to her\\nown sex; but when she met with such occasions as this was, a satiety of\\nenjoyments in the common road, perhaps, too a great secret bias,\\ninclined her to make the most of pleasure, wherever she could find it,\\nwithout distinction of sexes.',\n",
       " 'In this view, now well assured that she\\nhad, by her touches, sufficiently inflamed me for her purpose, she\\nrolled down the bed clothes gently, and I saw myself stretched naked,\\nmy shift being turned up to my neck, whilst I had no power or sense to\\noppose it.',\n",
       " 'Even my growing blushes expressed more desire than modesty,\\nwhilst the candle, left (to be sure not undesignedly) burning, threw a\\nfull light on my whole body.',\n",

       " 'I was “a bud of beauty” (this was her\\nstyle), “and how vastly all the fine men would admire me!” to all which\\nmy answers did not, I can assure you, wrong my breeding; they were as\\nsimple and silly as they could wish, and, no doubt, flattered them\\ninfinitely more than had they proved me enlightened by education and a\\nknowledge of the world.',\n",
       " 'We breakfasted, and the tea things were scarce removed, when in were\\nbrought two bundles of linen and wearing apparel: in short, all the\\nnecessaries for rigging me out, as they termed it, completely.',\n",
       " 'Imagine to yourself, Madam, how my little coquet heart fluttered with\\njoy at the sight of a white lutestring, flowered with silver, scoured\\nindeed, but passed on me for spick and span new, a Brussels lace cap,\\nbraited shoes, and the rest in proportion, all second-hand finery, and\\nprocured instantly for the occasion, by the diligence and industry of\\nthe good Mrs. Brown, who had already a chapman for me in the house,\\nbefore whom my charms were to pass in review; for he had not only, in\\ncourse, insisted on a previous sight of the premises, but also on\\nimmediate surrendering to him, in case of his agreeing for me;\\nconcluding very wisely, that such a place as I was in, was of the\\nhottest to trust the keeping of such a perishable commodity in, as a\\nmaidenhead.',\n",
       " 'The care of dressing and tricking me out for the market, was then left\\nto Phœbe, who acquitted herself, if not well, at least perfectly to the\\nsatisfaction of everything but my impatience of seeing myself dressed.',\n",
       " 'When it was over, and I viewed myself in the glass, I was no doubt, too\\nnatural, too artless, to hide my childish joy at the change: a change,\\nin the real truth, for much the worse, since I must have much better\\nbecome the neat easy simplicity of my rustic dress than the awkward,\\nuntoward, tawdry finery that I could not conceal my strangeness to.',\n",
       " 'Phœbe’s compliments, however, in which her own share in dressing me was\\nnot forgot, did not a little confirm me in the first notions I had ever\\nentertained concerning my person; which, be it said without vanity, was\\nthen tolerable to justify a taste for me, and of which it may not be\\nout of place here to sketch you an unflattered picture.',\n",
       " 'I was tall, yet not too tall for my age, which, as I before remarked,\\nwas barely turned of fifteen; my shape perfectly straight, thin\\nwaisted, and light and free without owing anything to stays; my hair\\nwas a glossy auburn, and as soft as silk, flowing down my neck in\\nnatural curls, and did not a little to set off the whiteness of a\\nsmooth skin; my face was rather too ruddy, though its features were\\ndelicate, and the shape was a roundish oval, except where a pit on my\\nchin had far from a disagreeable effect; my eyes were as black as can\\nbe imagined, and rather languishing than sparkling, except on certain\\noccasions, when I have been told they struck fire fast enough; my\\nteeth, which I ever carefully preserved, were small, even and white; my\\nbosom was finely raised, and one might then discern rather the promise\\nthan the actual growth of the round, firm breast, that in a little time\\nmade that promise good.',\n",
       " 'In short, all the points of beauty that are\\nmost universally in request, I had, or at least my vanity forbid me to\\nappeal from the decision of our sovereign judges the men, who all, that\\nI ever knew at last, gave it thus highly in my favour; and I met with,\\neven in my own sex, some that were above denying me that justice,\\nwhilst others praised me yet more unsuspectedly, by endeavouring to\\ndetract from me, in points of person and figure that I obviously\\nexcelled in.',\n",
       " 'This is, I own, too strong of self praise; but I should be\\nungrateful to nature, and to a form to which I owe such singular\\nblessings of pleasure and fortune, were I to suppress, through an\\naffectation of modesty, the mention of such valuable gifts.',\n",
       " 'Well then, dressed I was, and little did it then enter into my head\\nthat all this gay attire was no more than decking the victim out for\\nsacrifice, whilst I innocently attributed all to mere friendship and\\nkindness in the sweet good Mrs. Brown; who, I was forgetting to\\nmention, had, under pretence of keeping my money safe, got from me,\\nwithout the least hesitation, the driblet (so I now call it) which\\nremained to me after the expenses of my journey.',\n",
       " 'After some little time most agreebly spent before the glass, in scarce\\nself-admiration, since my new dress had by much the greatest share in\\nit, I was sent for down to the parlour, where the old lady saluted me,\\nand wished me joy of my new clothes, which she was not ashamed to say,\\nfitted me as if I had worn nothing but the finest all my life-time; but\\nwhat was it she could not see me silly enough to swallow?',\n",
       " 'At the same\\ntime, she presented me to another cousin of her own creation, an\\nelderly gentleman, who got up, at my entry into the room, and on my\\ndropping a curtsy to him, saluted me, and seemed a little affronted\\nthat I had only presented my cheek to him: a mistake, which, if one, he\\nimmediately corrected, by gluing his lips to mine, with an ardour which\\nhis figure had not at all disposed me to thank him for: his figure, I\\nsay, than which nothing could be more shocking or detestable: for ugly\\nand disagreeable were terms too gentle to convey a just idea of it.',\n",
       " 'Imagine to yourself, a man rather past threescore, short and ill-made,\\nwith a yellow cadaverous hue, great goggle eyes, that stared as if he\\nwas strangled; an out-mouth from two more properly tusks than teeth,\\nlivid lips, and breath like a Jake’s: then he had a peculiar\\nghastliness in his grin, that made him perfectly frightful, if not\\ndangerous to women with child; yet, made as he was thus in mock of man,\\nhe was so blind to his own staring deformities, as to think himself\\nborn to please, and that no woman could see him with impunity: in\\nconsequence of which idea, he had lavished great sums on such wretches\\nas could gain upon themselves to pretend love to his person, whilst to\\nthose who had not art or patience to dissemble the horror it inspired,\\nhe behaved even brutally.',\n",
       " 'Impotence, more than necessity, made him seek\\nin variety, the provocative that was wanting to raise him to the pitch\\nof enjoyment, which he too often saw himself baulked of, by the failure\\nof his powers: and this always threw him into a fit of rage, which he\\nwreaked, as far as he durst, on the innocent objects of his fit of\\nmomentary desire.',\n",
       " 'This then was the master to which my conscientious benefactress, who\\nhad long been his purveyor in this way, had doomed me, and sent for me\\ndown purposely for his examination.',\n",
       " 'Accordingly she made me stand up\\nbefore him, turned me round, unpinned my handkerchief, remarked to him\\nthe rise and fall, the turn and whiteness of a bosom just beginning to\\nfill; then made me walk, and took even a handle from the rusticity of\\nmy charms: in short, she omitted no point of jockeyship; to which he\\nonly answered by gracious nods of approbation, whilst he looked goats\\nand monkeys at me: for I sometimes stole a corner glance at him, and\\nencountering his fiery, eager stare, looked another way from pure\\nhorror and affright, which he, characteristically, attributed to\\nnothing more than maiden modesty, or at least the affectation of it.',\n",
       " 'However, I was soon dismissed, and reconducted to my room by Phœbe, who\\nstuck close to me, not leaving me alone, and at leisure to make such\\nreflections as might naturally rise to any one, not an idiot, on such a\\nscene as I had just gone through; but to my shame be it confessed, that\\njust was my invincible stupidity, or rather portentous innocence, that\\nI did not yet open my eyes to Mrs. Brown’s designs, and saw nothing in\\nthis titular cousin of hers but a shockingly hideous person, which did\\nnot at all concern me, unless that my gratitude for my benefactress\\nmade me extend my respect to all her cousinhood.',\n",
       " 'Phœbe, however, began to sift the state and pulses of my heart toward\\nthis monster, asking me how I should approve of such a fine gentelman\\nfor a husband.',\n",
       " '(Fine gentleman, I suppose she called him, from his\\nbeing daubed with lace.)',\n",
       " 'I answered her very naturally, that I had no\\nthoughts of a husband, but that if I was to choose one, it should be\\namong my own degree, sure!',\n",
       " 'so much had my aversion to that wretch’s\\nhideous figure indisposed me to all “fine gentlemen,” and confounded my\\nideas, as if those of that rank had been necessarily cast in the same\\nmould that he was.',\n",
       " 'But Phœbe was not to be put off so, but went on with\\nher endeavours to melt and soften me for the purposes of my reception\\ninto that hospitable house: and whilst she talked of the sex in\\ngeneral, she had no reason to despair of a compliance, which more than\\none reason showed her would be easily enough obtained of me; but then\\nshe had too much experience not to discover that my particular fixed\\naversion to that frightful cousin would be a block not so readily to be\\nremoved, as suited the consummation of their bargain, and sale of me.',\n",
       " 'Mother Brown had in the meantime agreed the terms with this loquorice\\nold goat, which I afterwards understood were to be fifty guineas\\nperemptory, for the liberty of attempting me, and a hundred more at the\\ncomplete gratification of his desires, in the triumph over my\\nvirginity: and as for me, I was to be left entirely at the discretion\\nof his liking and generosity.',\n",
       " 'This unrighteous contract being thus\\nsettled, he was so eager to be put in possession, that he insisted on\\nbeing introduced to drink tea with me that afternoon, when we were to\\nbe left alone; nor would he hearken to the procuress’s remonstrances,\\nthat I was not sufficiently prepared, and ripened for such an attack;\\nthat I was too green and untamed, having been scarce twenty-four hours\\nin the house: it is the character of lust to be impatient, and his\\nvanity arming him against any supposition of other than the common\\nresistance of a maid on those occasions, made him reject all proposals\\nof a delay, and my dreadful trial was thus fixed, unknown to me, for\\nthat very evening.',\n",
       " 'At dinner, Mrs. Brown and Phœbe did nothing but run riot in praise of\\nthis wonderful cousin, and how happy that woman would be that he would\\nfavour with his addresses; in short my two gossips exhausted all their\\nrhetoric to persuade me to accept them: “that the gentleman was\\nviolently smitten with me at first sight; that he would make my fortune\\nif I would be a good girl and not stand in my own light; that I should\\ntrust his honour; that I should be made for ever, and have a chariot to\\ngo abroad in,” with all such stuff as was fit to turn the head of such\\na silly ignorant girl as I then was: but luckily here my aversion had\\ntaken already such deep root in me, my heart was so strongly defended\\nfrom him by my senses, that wanting the art to mask my sentiments, I\\ngave them no hopes of their employer succeeding, at least very easily,\\nwith me.',\n",
       " 'The glass too marched pretty quick, with a view, I suppose, to\\nmake a friend of the warmth of my constitution, in the minutes of the\\nimminent attack.',\n",
       " 'Thus they kept me pretty long at table, and about six in the evening,\\nafter I had retired to my apartment, and the tea board was set, enters\\nmy venerable mistress, followed close by that satyr, who came in\\ngrinning in a way peculiar to him, and by his odious presence,\\nconfirmed me in all the sentiments of detestation which his first\\nappearance had given birth to.',\n",
       " 'He sat down fronting me, and all tea time kept ogling me in a manner\\nthat gave me the utmost pain and confusion, all the mark of which he\\nstill explained to be my bashfulness, and not being used to see\\ncompany.',\n",
       " 'Tea over, the commoding old lady pleady urgent business (which indeed\\nwas true) to go out, and earnestly desired me to entertain her cousin\\nkindly till she came back, both for my own sake and her; and then, with\\na “Pray, sir, be very good, be very tender to the sweet child,” she\\nwent out of the room, leaving me staring, with my mouth open, and\\nunprepared by the suddenness of her departure, to oppose it.',\n",
       " 'We were now alone; and on that idea a sudden fit of trembling seized\\nme.',\n",
       " 'I was so afraid, without a precise notion of why, and what I had to\\nfear, that I sat on the settee, by the fire side, motionless and\\npetrified, without life or spirit, not knowing how to look or how to\\nstir.',\n",
       " 'But long I was not suffered to remain in this state of stupefaction:\\nthe monster squatted down by me on the settee, and without farther\\nceremony or preamble, flings his arms about my neck, and drawing me\\npretty forcibly towards him, obliged me to receive, in spite of my\\nstruggles to disengage from him, his pestilential kisses, which quite\\novercame me.',\n",
       " 'Finding me then next to senseless, and unresisting, he\\ntears off my neck handkerchief, and laid all open there, to his eyes\\nand hands: still I endured all without flinching, till emboldened by my\\nsufferance and silence, for I had not the power to speak or cry out, he\\nattempted to lay me down on the settee, and I felt his hand on the\\nlower part of my naked thighs, which were crossed, and which he\\nendeavoured to unlock.',\n",
       " 'Oh then!',\n",
       " 'I was roused out of my passive\\nendurance, and springing from him with an activity he was not prepared\\nfor, threw myself at his feet, and begged him, in the most moving tone,\\nnot to be rude, and that he would not hurt me.',\n",
       " '“Hurt you, my dear?”\\nsays the brute, “I intend you no harm.',\n",
       " 'Has not the old lady told you\\nthat I love you?',\n",
       " 'that I shall do handsomely by you?”\\n\\n“She has indeed, sir,” said I, “but I cannot love you, indeed I cannot!',\n",
       " 'pray let me alone!',\n",
       " 'yes!',\n",
       " 'I will love you dearly if you will let me alone\\nand go away.” But I was talking to the wind, for whether my tears, my\\nattitude, or the disorder of my dress proved fresh incentives, or\\nwhether he was now under the dominion of desires he could not bridle,\\nbut snorting and foaming with lust and rage, he renews his attack,\\nseizes me, and again attempts to extend and fix me on the settee: in\\nwhich he succeeded so far as to lay me along, and even to toss my\\npetticoats over my head, and lay my thighs bare, which I obstinately\\nkept close, nor could he, though he attempted with his knee to force\\nthem open, effect it so as to stand fair for being master of the main\\navenue; he was unbuttoned, both waistcoat and breeches, yet I only felt\\nthe weight of his body upon me, whilst I lay struggling with\\nindignation, and dying with terrors; but he stopped all of a sudden,\\nand got off, panting, blowing, cursing, and repeating “old and ugly!”\\nfor so I had very naturally called him in the heat of my defence.',\n",
       " 'The brute had, it seems, as I afterwards understood, brought on, by his\\neagerness and struggle, the ultimate period of his hot fit of lust,\\nwhich his power was too short-lived to carry him through the full\\nexecution of; of which my thighs and linen received the effusion.',\n",
       " 'When it was over he bid me, with a tone of displeasure, get up: “that\\nhe would not do me the honour to think of me any more; that the old\\nb——h might look out for another cully; that he would not be fooled so\\nby ever a country mock modesty in England; that he supposed I had left\\nmy maidenhead with some hobnail in the country, and was come to dispose\\nof my skim-milk in town” with a volley of the like abuse; which I\\nlistened to with more pleasure than ever fond woman did to\\nprotestations of love from her darling minion: for, incapable as I was\\nof receiving any addition to my perfect hatred and aversion to him, I\\nlooked on this railing, as my security against his renewing his most\\nodious caress.',\n",
       " 'Yet, plain as Mrs. Brown’s views were now come out, I had not the\\nheart, or spirit to open my eyes to them: still I could not part with\\nmy dependence on that beldam, so much did I think myself hers, soul and\\nbody: or rather, I sought to deceive myself with the continuation of my\\ngood opinion of her, and choose to wait the worst at her hands, sooner\\nthan be turned out to starve in the streets, without a penny of money\\nor a friend to apply to these fears were my folly.',\n",
       " 'While this confusion of ideas was passing in my head, and I sat\\npensively by the fire, with my eyes brimming with tears, my neck still\\nbare, and my cap fallen off in the struggle, so that my hair was in the\\ndisorder you may guess, the villain’s lust began, I suppose, to be\\nagain in flow, at the sight of all that bloom of youth which presented\\nitself to his view, a bloom yet unenjoyed, and of course not yet\\nindifferent to him.',\n",
       " 'After some pause, he asked me with a tone of voice mightily softer,\\nwhether I would make it up with him before the old lady returned, and\\nall should be well; he would restore me to his affections, at the same\\ntime offering to kiss me and feel my breasts.',\n",
       " 'But now my extreme\\naversion, my fears, my indignation, all acting upon me, gave me a\\nspirit not natural to me, so that breaking loose from him, I ran to the\\nbell and rang it, with such violence and effect as to bring up the maid\\nto know what was the matter, or whether the gentleman wanted anything;\\nand before he could proceed to greater extremities, she bounced into\\nthe room, and seeing me stretched on the floor, my hair all\\ndishevelled, my nose gushing out blood, which did not a little\\ntragedize the scene, and my odious persecutor still intent of pushing\\nhis brutal point, unmoved by all my cries and distress, she was herself\\nconfounded and did not know what to do.',\n",
       " 'As much, however, as Martha might be prepared and hardened to\\ntransactions of this sort, all womanhood must have been out of her\\nheart could she have seen this unmoved.',\n",
       " 'Besides that, on the face of\\nthings, she imagined that matters had gone greater lengths than they\\nreally had, and that the courtesy of the house had been actually\\nconsummated on me, and flung: me into the condition I was in: in this\\nnotion she instantly took my part, and advised the gentleman to go down\\nand leave me to recover myself, and “that all would be soon over with\\nme; that when Mrs. Brown and Phœbe, who were gone out, were returned,\\nthey would take order for everything to his satisfaction; that nothing\\nwould be lost by a little patience with the poor tender thing; that for\\nher part she was frightened; she could not tell what to say to such\\ndoings; but that she would stay by me till my mistress came home.” As\\nthe wench said all this in a resolute tone, and the monster himself\\nbegan to perceive that things would not mend by his staying, he took\\nhis hat and went out of the room murmuring and pitting his brows like\\nan old ape, so that I was delivered from the horrors of his detestable\\npresence.',\n",
       " 'As soon as he was gone, Martha very tenderly offered me her assistance\\nin anything, and would have got me some hartshorn drops and put me to\\nbed; which last I, at first, positively refused, in the fear that the\\nmonster might return and take me at that disadvantage.',\n",
       " 'However, with\\nmuch persuasion and assurances that I should not be molested that night\\nshe prevailed on me to lie down; and indeed I was so weakened by my\\nstruggles, so dejected by my fearful apprehension, so terror-struck,\\nthat I had not power to sit up, or hardly to give answers to the\\nquestions with which the curious Martha plied and perplexed me.',\n",
       " 'Such too, and so cruel was my fate, that I dreaded the sight of Mrs.\\nBrown, as if I had been the criminal, and she the person injured; a\\nmistake which you will not think so strange, on distinguishing that\\nneither virtue nor principles had the least share in the defence I had\\nmade, but only the particular aversion I had conceived against this\\nfirst brutal and frightful invader of my tender innocence.',\n",
       " 'I passed then the time till Mrs. Brown came home, under all the\\nagitations of fear and despair that may easily be guessed.',\n",
       " 'About eleven at night my two ladies came home, and having received\\nrather a favourable account from Martha, who had run down to let them\\nin, for Mr. Crofts (that was the name of my brute) was gone out of the\\nhouse, after waiting till he had tired his patience for Mrs. Brown’s\\nreturn, they came thundering up stairs, and seeing me pale, my face\\nbloody, and all the marks of the most thorough dejection, they employed\\nthemselves more to comfort and re-inspirit me than in making me the\\nreproaches I was weak enough to fear, I who had so many juster and\\nstronger to retort upon them.',\n",
       " 'Mrs. Brown withdrawn, Phœbe came presently to bed to me, and what with\\nthe answers she drew from me, what with her own method of palpably\\nsatisfying herself, she soon discovered that I had been more frightened\\nthan hurt; upon which I suppose, being herself seized with sleep, and\\nreserving her lectures and instructions till the next morning, she left\\nme, properly speaking, to my unrest; for, later tossing and turning the\\ngreatest part of the night, and tormenting myself with the falsest\\nnotions and apprehensions of things, I fell, through mere fatigue into\\na kind of delirious doze, out of which I waked late in the morning, in\\na violent fever: a circumstance which was extremely critical to\\nreprieve me, at least for a time, from the attacks of a wretch,\\ninfinitely more terrible to me than death itself.',\n",
       " 'The interested care that was taken of me during my illness, in order to\\nrestore me to a condition of making good the bawd’s engagements, or of\\nenduring further trials, had, however, such an effect on my grateful\\ndisposition that I even thought myself obliged to my un-doers for their\\nattention to promote my recovery; and, above all, for the keeping out\\nof my sight of that brutal ravisher, the author of my disorder, on\\ntheir finding I was too strongly moved at the bare mention of his name.',\n",
       " 'Youth is soon raised, and a few days were sufficient to conquer the\\nfury of my fever: but, what contributed most to my perfect recovery and\\nto my reconciliation with life, was the timely news that Mr. Crofts,\\nwho was a merchant of considerable dealings, was arrested at the King’s\\nsuit, for nearly forty thousand pounds, on account of his driving a\\ncertain contraband trade, and that his affairs were so desperate, that\\neven were it in his inclination, it would not be in his power to renew\\nhis designs upon me: for he was instantly thrown into a prison, which\\nit was not likely he would get out of in haste.',\n",
       " 'Mrs. Brown, who had touched his fifty guineas, advanced to so little\\npurpose, and lost all hopes of the remaining hundred, began to look\\nupon my treatment of him with a more favourable eye; and as they had\\nobserved my temper to be perfectly tractable and conformable to their\\nviews, all the girls that composed her flock were suffered to visit me,\\nand had their cue to dispose me, by their conversation, to a perfect\\nresignation of myself to Mrs. Brown’s direction.',\n",

       " 'Phœbe could not hear it to the end without more than one interruption\\nby peals of laughter, and my ingenuous way of relating matters did not\\na little heighten the joke to her.',\n",
       " 'But, on her sounding me how the sight had affected me, without mincing\\nor hiding the pleasurable emotions it had inspired me with, I told her\\nat the same time that one remark had perplexed me, and that very\\nconsiderably.',\n",
       " '“Aye!” says she, “what was that?” “Why,” replied I,\\n“having very curiously and attentively compared the size of that\\nenormous machine, which did not appear, at least to my fearful\\nimagination, less than my wrist, and at least three of my hand-fuls\\nlong, to that of the tender small part of me which was framed to\\nreceive it, I could not conceive its being possible to afford it\\nentrance without dying, perhaps in the greatest pain, since she well\\nknew that even a finger thrust in there hurt me beyond bearing.',\n",
       " 'As to\\nmy mistress’s and yours, I can very plainly distinguish the different\\ndimensions of them from mine, palpable to the touch, and visible to the\\neye; so that, in short, great as the promised pleasure may be, I am\\nafraid of the pain of the experiment.”\\n\\nPhœbe at this redoubled her laugh, and whilst I expected a very serious\\nsolution of my doubts and apprehensions in this matter, only told me\\nthat “she never heard of a mortal wound being given in those parts, by\\nthat terrible weapon, and that some she knew younger, and as delicately\\nmade as myself, had outlived the operation; that she believed, at the\\nworst, I should take a great deal of liking; that true it was, there\\nwas a great diversity of sizes in those parts, owing to nature,\\nchild-bearing, frequent over-stretching with unmerciful machines, but\\nthat at a certain age and habit of body, even the most experienced in\\nthose affairs could not well distinguish between the maid and the\\nwoman, supposing too an absence of all artifice, in their natural\\nsituation: but that since chance had thrown in my way one sight of that\\nsort, she would procure me another, that should feast my eyes more\\ndelicately, and go a great way in the cure of my fears from that\\nimaginary disproportion”.',\n",

       " 'At five in the evening next day, Phœbe, punctual to her promise, came\\nto me as I sat alone in my own room, and beckoned me to follow her.',\n",
       " 'We went down the back stairs very softly, and opening the door of a\\ndark closet, where there was some old furniture kept, and some cases of\\nliquor, she drew me in after her, and fastened the door upon us, we had\\nno light but what came through a long crevice in the partition between\\nours and the light closet, where the scene of action lay; so that\\nsitting on those low cases, we could, with the greatest ease, as well\\nas clearness, see all objects (ourselves unseen), only by applying our\\neyes close to the crevice, where the moulding of a panel had warped, or\\nstarted a little on the other side.',\n",

       " 'When he saw this, his breeches were immediately loosened, waist and\\nknee bands, and slipped over his ankles, clean off; his shirt collar\\nwas unbottoned too: then, first giving Polly an encouraging kiss, he\\nstole, as it were, the shift off the girl, who being, I suppose, broke\\nand familiarized to this humour, blushed indeed, but less than I did at\\nthe apparition of her, now standing stark naked, just as she came ont\\nof the hands of pure nature, with her black hair loose and a-float down\\nher dazzling white neck and shoulders, whilst the deepened carnation of\\nher cheeks went off gradually into the hue of glazed snow: for such\\nwere the blended tints polish of her skin.',\n",
       " 'This girl could not be above eighteen: her face regular and sweet\\nfeatured, her shape exquisite; nor could I help envying her two ripe\\nenchanting breasts, finely plumped out in flesh, but withal so round,\\nso firm, that they sustained themselves, in scorn of any stay: then\\ntheir nipples, pointing different ways, marked their pleasing\\nseparation; beneath them lay the delicious tract of the belly, which\\nterminated in a parting of rift scarce discerning, that modesty seemed\\nto retire downward, and seek shelter between two plump fleshy thighs:\\nthe curling hair that overspread its delightful front, clothed it with\\nthe richest sable fur in the universe: in short, she was evidently a\\nsubject for the painters to court her, sitting to them for a pattern\\nfemale beauty, in all the true pride and pomp of nakedness.',\n",
       " 'The young Italian (still in his shirt) stood gazing and transported at\\nthe sight of beauties that might have fired a dying hermit; his eager\\neyes devoured her, as she shifted attitudes at his discretion: neither\\nwere his hands excluded their share of the high feast, but wandered, on\\nthe hunt of pleasure, over every part and inch of her body, so\\nqualified to afford the most exquisite sense of it.',\n",
       " 'In the mean time time, one could not help observing the swell of his\\nshirt before, that bolstered out, and pointed out the condition of\\nthings behind the curtain: but he soon removed it, by slipping his\\nshirt over his head; and now, as to nakedness, they had nothing to\\nreproach one another.',\n",

       " 'His hair being too short to tie fell no\\nlower than his neck, in short easy curls; and he had a few sprigs about\\nhis paps, that garnished his chest in a style of strength and\\nmanliness.',\n",
       " 'Then his grand movement, which seemed to rise out of a\\nthicket of curling hair, that spread from the root all over his thighs\\nand belly up to the navel, stood stiff and upright, but of a size to\\nfrighten me, by sympathy for the small tender part which was the object\\nof its fury, and which now lay exposed to my fairest view; for he had,\\nimmediately on stoppings off his shirt, gently pushed her down on the\\ncouch, which stood conveniently to break her willing fall.',\n",
       " 'Her thighs\\nwere spread out to their utmost extention, and discovered between them\\nthe mark of the sex, the red-centered cleft of flesh, whose lips\\nvermillioning inwards, expressed a small ruby line in sweet miniature,\\nsuch as Guide’s touch or colouring: could never attain to the life or\\ndelicacy of.',\n",

       " 'His thighs, finely fashioned, and with a florid glossy roundness,\\ngradually tapering away to the knees, seemed pillars worthy to support\\nthat beauteous frame at the bottom of which I could not, without some\\nremains of terror, some tender emotions too, fix my eyes on that\\nterrible machine, which had, not long before, with such fury broke\\ninto, torn, and almost ruined those soft, tender parts of mine, that\\nhad not yet done smarting with the effects of its rage; but behold it\\nnow!',\n",
       " 'crest fallen, reclining its half-caped vermilion head over one of\\nhis thighs, quiet, pliant, and to all appearances incapable of the\\nmischiefs and cruelty it had committed.',\n",
       " 'Then the beautiful growth of\\nthe hair, in short and soft curls round its roots, its whiteness,\\nbranched veins, the supple softness of the shaft, as it lay\\nforeshortened, rolled and shrunk up into a squat thickness, languid,\\nand borne up from between his thighs, by its globular appendage, that\\nwondrous treasure bag of nature’s sweets, which revelled round, and\\npursed up in the only wrinkles that are known to please, perfected the\\nprospect, and altogether formed the most interesting moving picture in\\nnature, and surely infinitely superior to those nudities furnished by\\nthe painters, statuaries, or any art, which are purchased at immense\\nprices; whilst the sight of them in actual life is scarce sovereignly\\ntasted by any but the few whom nature has endowed with a fire of\\nimagination, warmly pointed by a truth of judgment to the spring-head,\\nthe originals of beauty, of nature’s unequalled composition, above all\\nthe imitations of art, or the reach of wealth to pay their price.',\n",

       " 'and, scarce giving me\\ntime to answer, imprinted on my lips one of his burning rapture kisses,\\nwhich darted a flame to my heart, that from thence radiated to every\\npart of me; and presently, as if he had proudly meant revenge for the\\nsurvey I had smuggled of all his naked beauties, he spurns off the bed\\nclothes, and trussing up my shift as high as it would go, took his turn\\nto feast his eyes on all the gifts nature had bestowed on my person;\\nhis busy hands, too, ranged intemperately over every part of me.',\n",
       " 'The\\ndelicious austerity and hardness of my yet unripe budding breasts, the\\nwhiteness and firmness of my flesh, the freshness and regularity of my\\nfeatures, the harmony of my limbs, all seemed to confirm him in his\\nsatisfaction with his bargain; but when curious to explore the havock\\nhe had made in the centre of his over fierce attack, he not only\\ndirected his hands there, but with a pillow put under, placed me\\nfavourably for his wanton purpose of inspection.',\n",
       " 'Then, who can express\\nthe fire his eyes glistened, his hands glowed with!',\n",
       " 'whilst sighs of\\npleasure, and tender broken exclamations, were all the praises he could\\nutter.',\n",

       " 'But now this visit of my soft, warm hand, in those so sensible parts,\\nhad put every thing into such ungovernable fury, disdaining all further\\npreluding, and taking advantage of my commodious posture, he made the\\nstorm fall where I scarce patiently expected, and where he was sure to\\nlay it: presently, then, I felt the stiff intersection betwen the\\nyielding, divided lips of the wound, now open for life; where the\\nnarrowness no longer put me to intolerable pain, and afforded my lover\\nno more difficulty than what heightened his pleasure, in the strict\\nembrace of that tender, warm sheath, round the instrument it was so\\ndelicately adjusted to, and which now cased home, so gorged me with\\npleasure, that it perfectly suffocated me and took away my breath; then\\nthe killing thrusts!',\n",

       " 'In our calmer intervals Charles gave the following account of himself,\\nevery tittle of which was true.',\n",
       " 'He was the only son of a father, who,\\nhaving a small post in the revenue, rather overlived his income, and\\nhad given this young gentleman a very slender education: no profession\\nhad he bred him up to, but designed to provide for him in the army, by\\npurchasing him an ensign’s commission, that is to say, provided he\\ncould raise the money, or procure it by interest, either of which\\nclauses was rather to be wished than hoped for by him.',\n",
       " 'On no better a\\nplan, however, had his improvident father suffered this youth, a youth\\nof great promise, to run up to the age of manhood, or near it at least,\\nin next to idleness; and had, besides, taken no sort of pains to give\\nhim even the common premonitions against the vices of the town, and the\\ndangers of all sorts which wait the unexperienced and unwary in it.',\n",
       " 'He\\nlived at home, and at discretion with his father, who himself kept a\\nmistress; and for the rest, provided Charles did not ask him for money,\\nhe was indolently kind to him: he might lie out when he pleased, any\\nexcuse would serve, and even his reprimands were so slight, that they\\ncarried with them rather an air of connivance at the fault, than any\\nserious control or constraint.',\n",
       " 'But, to supply his calls for money,\\nCharles, whose mother was dead, had, by her side, a grandmother, who\\ndoated upon him.',\n",
       " 'She had a considerable annuity to live on, and very\\nregularly parted with every shilling she could spare, to this darling\\nof her’s, to the no little heart-burn of his father; who was vexed, not\\nthat she, by this means, fed his son’s extravagance, but that she\\npreferred Charles to himself; and we shall too soon see what a fatal\\nturn such a mercenary jealousy could operate on the breast of a father.',\n",
       " 'Charles was, however, by the means of his grandmother’s lavish\\nfondness, very sufficiently enabled to keep a mistress, so easily\\ncontented as my love made me; and my good fortune, for such I must ever\\ncall it, threw me in his way, in the manner above related, just as he\\nwas on the look-out for one.',\n",
       " 'As to temper, the even sweetness of it made him seem born for domestic\\nhappiness: tender, naturally polite, and gentle-manner’d; it could\\nnever be his fault, if ever jars, or animosities ruffled a calm he was\\nso qualified every way to maintain or restore.',\n",
       " 'Without those great or\\nshining qualities that constitute a genius, or are fit to make a noise\\nin the world, he had all those humble ones that compose the softer\\nsocial merit: plain common sense, set off with every grace of modesty\\nand good nature, made him, if not admired, what is much happier:\\nuniversally beloved and esteemed.',\n",
       " 'But, as nothing but the beauties of\\nhis person had at first attracted my regard and fixed my passion,\\nneither was I then a judge of the internal merit, which I had\\nafterwards full occasion to discover, and which, perhaps, in that\\nseason of giddiness and levity, would have touched my heart very\\nlittle, had it been lodged in a person less the delight of my eyes, and\\nidol of my senses.',\n",
       " 'But to return to our situation.',\n",
       " 'After dinner, which we ate a-bed in most voluptuous disorder, Charles\\ngot up, and taking a passionate leave of me for a few hours, went to\\ntown, where concerting matters with a young sharp lawyer, they went\\ntogether to my late venerable mistress’s, from whence I had, but the\\nday before, made my elopement, and with whom he was determined to\\nsettle accounts, in a manner that should cut off all after reckonings\\nfrom that quarter.',\n",
       " 'Accordingly they went; but by the way, the Templar, his friend, on\\nthinking over Charles’s information, saw reason to give their visit\\nanother turn, and, instead of offering satisfaction, to demand it.',\n",
       " 'On being let in, the girls of the house flocked round Charles, whom\\nthey knew, and from the earlyness of my escape, and their perfect\\nignorance of his ever having so much as seen me, not having the least\\nsuspicion of his being accessory to my flight, they were, in their way,\\nmaking up to him; and as to his companion, they took him probably for a\\nfresh cully.',\n",
       " 'But the Templar soon checked their forwardness, by\\nenquiring for the old lady, with whom he said, with a grave-like\\ncountenance, that he had some business to settle.',\n",
       " 'Madam was immediately sent for down, and the ladies being desired to\\nclear the room, the lawyer asked her, severely, if she did know, or had\\nnot decoyed, under pretence of hiring as a servant, a young girl, just\\ncome out of the country, called Frances or Fanny Hill, describing me\\nwithal as particularly as he could from Charlie’s description.',\n",
       " 'It is peculiar to vice to tremble at the enquiries of justice; and Mrs.\\nBrown, whose conscience was not entirely clear upon my account, as\\nknowing as she was of the town as hackneyed as she was in bluffing\\nthrough all the dangers of her vocation, could not help being alarmed\\nat the questions, especially when he went on to talk of a Justice of\\npeace, Newgate, the Old Bailey, indictments for keeping a disorderly\\nhouse, pillory, carting, and the whole process of that nature.',\n",
       " 'She,\\nwho, it is likely, imagined I had lodged an information against her\\nhouse, looked extremely blank, and began to make a thousand\\nprotestations and excuses.',\n",
       " 'However, to abridge, they brought away\\ntriumphantly my box of things, which, had she not ben under an awe, she\\nmight have disputed with them; and not only that, but a clearance and\\ndischarge of any demands on the house, at the expense of no more than a\\nbowl of arrack-punch, the treat of which, together with the choice of\\nthe house conveniences, was offered and not accepted.',\n",
       " 'Charles all the\\ntime acted the chance companion of the lawyer, who had brought him\\nthere, as he knew the house, and appeared in no wise interested in the\\nissue; but he had the collateral pleasure of hearing all that I told\\nhim verified, as far as the bawd’s fears would give her leave to enter\\ninto my history, which, if one may guess by the composition she so\\nreadily came into, were not small.',\n",
       " 'Phœbe, my kind tutoress Phœbe, was at the time gone out, perhaps in\\nsearch of me, or their cooked-up story had not, it is probable, passed\\nsmoothly.',\n",
       " 'This negociation had, however, taken up some time, which would have\\nappeared much longer to me, left as I was, in a strange house, if the\\nlandlady, a motherly sort of a woman, to whom Charles had liberally\\nrecommended me, had not come up and borne me company.',\n",
       " 'We drank tea, and\\nher chat helped to pass away the time very agreeably, since he was our\\ntheme; but as the evening deepened, and the hour set for his return was\\nelapsed, I could not dispel the gloom of impatience, and tender fears\\nwhich gathered upon me, and which our timid sex are apt to feel in\\nproportion to their love.',\n",
       " 'Long, however, I did not suffer: the sight of him over-paid me; and the\\nsoft reproach I had prepared for him, expired before it reached my\\nlips.',\n",
       " 'I was still a-bed, yet unable to use my legs otherwise than awkwardly,\\nand Charles flew to me, catches me in his arms, raised and extending\\nmine to meet his dear embrace, and gives me an account, interrupted by\\nmany a sweet parenthesis of kisses, of the success of his measures.',\n",
       " 'I could not help laughing at the fright of the old woman had been put\\ninto, which my ignorance, and indeed my want of innocence, had far from\\nprepared me from bespeaking.',\n",
       " 'She had, it seems, apprehended that I fled\\nthe shelter to some relation I had recollected in town, on my dislike\\nof their ways and proceedings towards me, and that this application\\ncame from thence; for, as Charles had rightly judged, not one neighbour\\nhad, at that still hour, seen the circumstance of my escape into the\\ncoach, or, at least, noticed him; neither had any in the house, the\\nleast hint of suspicion of my having spoken to him, much less of my\\nhaving clapt up such a sudden bargain with a perfect stranger, thus the\\ngreatest improbability is not always what we should most mistrust.',\n",
       " 'We supped with all the gaiety of two young giddy creatures at the top\\nof their desires; and as I had given up to Charles the whole charge of\\nmy future happiness, I thought of nothing beyond the exquisite pleasure\\nof possessing him.',\n",
       " 'He came to bed in due time; and this second night, the pain being\\npretty well over, I tasted, in full draught, all the transports of\\nperfect enjoyment: I swam, I bathed in bliss, till both fell asleep,\\nthrough the natural consequences of satisfied desires, and appeased\\nflames; nor did we wake but to renewed raptures.',\n",
       " 'Thus, making the most of love, and life did we stay in this lodging in\\nChelsea about ten days; in which time Charles took care to give his\\nexcursions from home a favourable gloss, and to keep his footing with\\nhis fond indulgent grand-mother, from whom he drew constant and\\nsufficient supplies for the charge I was to him, and which was very\\ntrifling, in comparison with his former less regular course of\\npleasure.',\n",
       " 'Charles removed me then to a private ready furnished lodging in D....\\nstreet, St. James’s, where he paid half a guinea a week for two rooms\\nand a closet on the second floor, which he had been some time looking\\nout for, and was more convenient for the frequency of his visits, than\\nwhere he had at first placed me, in a house, which I cannot say but I\\nleft with regret, as it was infinitely endeared to me by the first\\npossession of my Charles, and the circumstance of losing, there, that\\njewel, which can never be twice lost.',\n",
       " 'The landlord, however, had no\\nreason to complain of any thing, but of a procedure in Charles too\\nliberal not to make him regret the loss of us.',\n",
       " 'Arrived at our new lodging, I remember I thought them extremely fine,\\nthough ordinary enough, even at that price; but, had it been a dungeon\\nthat Charles had brought me to, his presence would have made a little\\nVersailles.',\n",
       " 'The landlady, Mrs. Jones, waited on us to our apartment, and with great\\nvolubility of tongue, explained to us all its conveniences: “that her\\nown maid should wait on us... that the best of quality had lodged at\\nher house... that her first floor was let to a foreign secretary of an\\nembassy, and his lady... that I looked like a very good natured\\nlady...” At the word lady, I blushed out of flattered vanity: this was\\nstrong for a girl of my condition; for though Charles had the\\nprecaution of dressing me in a less tawdry flaunting style than were\\nthe clothes I escaped to him in, and of passing me for his wife, that\\nshe had secretly married, and kept private (the old story) on account\\nof his friends, I dare swear this appeared extremely apocryphal to a\\nwoman who knew the town so well as she did; but that was the least of\\nher concern: it was impossible to be less scruple-ridden than she was;\\nand the advantage of letting her rooms being her sole object, the truth\\nitself would have far from scandalized her, or broke her bargain.',\n",
       " 'A sketch of her picture, and personal history, will dispose you to\\naccount for the part she is to act in my concern.',\n",
       " 'She was about forty six years old, tall, meagre, red-haired, with one\\nof those trivial ordinary faces you meet with every where, and go about\\nunheeded and un-mentioned.',\n",
       " 'In her youth she had been kept by a\\ngentleman, who, dying, left her forty pounds a year during her life, in\\nconsideration of a daughter he had by her: which daughter, at the age\\nof seventeen, she sold, for not a very considerable sum neither, to a\\ngentleman who was going on envoy abroad, and took his purchase with\\nhim, where he used her with the utmost tenderness, and it is thought,\\nwas secretly married to her: but had constantly made a point of her not\\nkeeping up the least correspondence with a mother base enough to make a\\nmarket of her own flesh and blood.',\n",
       " 'However, as she had not nature, nor,\\nindeed, any passion but that of money, this gave her no further\\nuneasiness, then, as she thereby lost a handle of squeezing presents,\\nor other after advantages, out of the bargain.',\n",
       " 'Indifferent then, by\\nnature of constitution, to every other pleasure but that of increasing\\nthe lump, by any means whatever, she commenced a kind of private\\nprocuress, for which she was not amiss fitted, by her grave decent\\nappearance, and sometimes did a job in the match-making way; in short,\\nthere was, nothing that appeared to her under the shape of gain, that\\nshe would not have undertaken.',\n",
       " 'She knew most of the ways of the town,\\nhaving not only herself been upon, but kept up constant intelligences\\nin promoting a harmony between the two sexes, in private pawn-broking,\\nand other profitable secrets.',\n",
       " 'She rented the house she lived in, and\\nmade the most of it, by letting it out in lodgings; though she was\\nworth, at least, near three or four thousand pounds, she would not\\nallow herself even the necessaries, of life, and pinned her subsistence\\nentirely on what she could squeeze out of her lodgers.',\n",
       " 'When she saw such a young pair come under her roof, her immediate\\nnotions, doubtless, were how she should make the most money of us, by\\nevery means that money might be made, and which, she rightly judged,\\nour situations and inexperience would soon beget her occasions of.',\n",
       " 'In this hopeful sanctuary, and under the clutches of this harpy, did we\\npitch our residence.',\n",
       " 'It will not be might material to you, or very\\npleasant to me, to enter into a detail of all the petty cut-throat ways\\nand means with which she used to fleece us; all which Charles\\nindolently chose to bear with, rather than take the trouble of\\nremoving, the difference of expense being scarce attended to by a young\\ngentleman who had no ideas of stint, or even economy, and a raw country\\ngirl who knew nothing of the matter.',\n",
       " 'Here, however, under the wings of my sovereignly beloved, did the most\\ndelicious hours of my life flow on; my Charles I had, and, in him,\\nevery thing my fond heart could wish or desire.',\n",
       " 'He carried me to plays,\\noperas, masquerades, and every diversion of the town; all which pleased\\nme, indeed, but pleased me infinitely the more for his being with me,\\nand explaining every thing to me, and enjoying perhaps, the natural\\nimpressions of surprise and admiration, which such sights, at the\\nfirst, never fail to excite in a country girl, new to the delights of\\nthem; but to me, they sensibly proved the power and dominion of the\\nsole passion of my heart over me, a passion in which soul and body were\\nconcentered, and left me no room for any other relish of life but love.',\n",
       " 'As to the men I saw at those places, or at any other, they suffered so\\nmuch in the comparison my eyes made of them with my all-perfect Adonis,\\nthat I had not the infidelity even of one wandering thought to reproach\\nmyself with upon his account.',\n",
       " 'He was the universe to me, and all that\\nwas not him, was nothing to me.',\n",
       " 'My love, in fine, was so excessive, that is arrived at annihilating\\nevery suggestion or kindling spark of jealousy; for, one idea only,\\ntending that way, gave me such exquisite torment, that my self-love,\\nand dread of worse than death, made me for ever renounce and defy it:\\nnor had I, indeed, occasion; for, were I to enter here on the recital\\nof several instances wherein Charles sacrificed to me women of much\\ngreater importance than I dare hint (which, considering his form, was\\nno such wonder), I might, indeed, give you full proof of his unshaken\\nconstancy to me; but would not you accuse me of warming up against a\\nfeast, which my vanity ought long ago to have been satisfied with?',\n",
       " 'In our cessations from active pleasure, Charles framed himself one, in\\ninstructing me, as far as his own lights reached, in a great many\\npoints of life, that I was, in consequence of my no-education,\\nperfectly ignorant of: nor did I suffer one word to fall in vain from\\nthe mouth of my lovely teacher: I hung on every syllable he uttered,\\nand received, as oracles, all he said; whilst kisses were all the\\ninterruption I could not refuse myself the pleasure of admitting, from\\nlips that breathed more than Arabian sweetness, I was in a little time\\nenabled, by the progress I had made, to prove the deep regard I had\\npaid to all that he had said to me: repeating it to him almost word for\\nword; and to shew that I was not entirely the parrot, but that I\\nreflected upon, that I entered into it, I joined my own comments, and\\nasked him questions of explanation.',\n",
       " 'My country accent, and the rusticity of my gait, manners, and\\ndeportment, began now sensibly to wear off: so quick was my\\nobservation, and so efficacious my desire of growing every day worthier\\nof his heart.',\n",
       " 'As to money, though, he brought me constantly all he received, it was\\nwith difficulty he even got me to give it room in my bureau; and what\\nclothes I had, he could prevail on me to accept of on no other foot,\\nthan that of pleasing him by the greater neatness in my dress, beyond\\nwhich I had no ambition.',\n",
       " 'I could have made a pleasure of the greatest\\ntoil, and worked my fingers to the bone, with joy, to have supported\\nhim: guess, then, if I could harbour any idea of being burthensome to\\nhim, and this disinterested turn in me was so unaffected, so much the\\ndictate of my heart, that Charles could not but feel it: and if he did\\nnot love me as much as I did him (which was the constant and only\\nmatter of sweet contention between us), he managed so, at least, as to\\ngive me the satisfaction of believing it impossible for man to be more\\ntender, more true, more faithful than he was.',\n",
       " 'Our landlady, Mrs. Jones, came frequently up to my apartment, from\\nwhence I never stirred on any pretext without Charles; nor was it long\\nbefore she wormed out, without much art, the secret of our having\\ncheated the church of a ceremony, and, in course, of the terms we lived\\ntogether upon; a circumstance which far from displeased her,\\nconsidering the designs she had upon me, and which, alas!',\n",
       " 'she will have\\ntoo soon, room to carry into execution.',\n",

       " 'But when\\nmy new master, for in that light I then viewed him, applied himself to\\nappease me, as my whole rage was levelled at myself, no part of which I\\nthought myself permitted to aim at him, I begged of him with more\\nsubmission than anger, to leave me alone, that I might, at least, enjoy\\nmy affliction in quiet.',\n",

       " 'However, as the first enjoyment is decisive, and he was now over the\\nbar, I thought I had no longer a right to refuse the caresses of one\\nthat had got that advantage over me, no matter how obtained; conforming\\nmyself then to this maxim, I considered myself as so much in his power,\\nthat I endured his kisses and embraces without affecting struggles or\\nanger; not that he, as yet, gave me any pleasure, or prevailed over the\\naversion of my soul, to give myself up to any sensation of that sort;\\nwhat I suffered, I suffered out of a kind of gratitude, and as a matter\\nof course what had passed.',\n",
       " 'He was, however, so regardful as not to attempt the renewal of those\\nextremities which had thrown me, just before, into such violent\\nagitations; but, now secure of possession, contented himself with\\nbringing me to temper by degrees, and waiting at the hand of time for\\nthose fruits of generosity and courtship, which he since often\\nreproached himself with having gathered much too green, when, yielding\\nto the inability to resist him, and overborne by desires, he had\\nwreaked his passion on a mere lifeless, spiritless body, dead to all\\npurpose of joy, since taking none, it ought to be supposed incapable of\\ngiving any.',\n",
       " 'This is, however, certain; my heart never thoroughly\\nforgave him the manner in which I had fallen to him, although, in point\\nof interest, I had fallen to him, I had reason to be pleased that he\\nfound, in my person, wherewithal to keep him from leaving me as easily\\nas he had had me.',\n",

       " 'Here I fell into a gentle breathing slumber, which\\nstole upon my senses, as they fainted under the excessive heat of the\\nseason at that hour; a cane couch, with my work basked for a pillow,\\nwere all the conveniences of my short repose; for I was soon awaked and\\nalarmed by a flounce, and noise of splashing in the water.',\n",
       " 'I got up to\\nsee what was the matter; and what indeed should it be but the son of a\\nneighbouring gentleman, as I afterwards found (for I had never seen him\\nbefore), who had strayed that way with his gun, and heated by his\\nsport, and the sultriness of the day, had been tempted by the freshness\\nof the clear stream; so that presently stripping, he jumped into it on\\nthe other side, which bordered on a wood, some trees whereof, inclined\\ndown to the water, formed a pleasing shady recess, commodious to\\nundress and leave his clothes under.',\n",
       " '“My first emotions at the sight of this youth, naked in the water,\\nwere, with all imaginable respect to truth, those of surprise and fear;\\nand, in course, I should immediately have run out, had not my modesty,\\nfatally for itself, interposed the objection of the door and window\\nbeing so situated, that it was scarce possible to get out, and make my\\nway along the bank to the house, without his seeing me: which I could\\nnot bear the thought of, so much ashamed and confounded was I at having\\nseen him.',\n",
       " 'Condemned then to stay till his departure should release me,\\nI was greatly embarrassed how to dispose of myself: I kept some time\\nbetwixt terror and modesty, even from looking through the window, which\\nbeing an old fashioned casement, without any light behind me, could\\nhardly betray any one’s being there to him from within; then the door\\nwas so secure, that without violence, or my own consent, there was no\\nopening it from without.',\n",
       " '“But now, by my own experience, I found it too true, that objects which\\naffright us, when we cannot get from them, draw our eyes as forcibly as\\nthose that please us.',\n",
       " 'I could not long withstand that nameless impulse,\\nwhich, without any desire of this novel sight, compelled me towards it;\\nemboldened too by my certainty of being at once unseen and safe, I\\nventured by degrees to cast my eyes on an object so terrible and\\nalarming to my virgin modesty as a naked man.',\n",
       " '“But as I snatched a look, the first gleam that struck me, was in\\ngeneral the dewy lustre of the whitest skin imaginable, which the sun\\nplaying upon made the reflection of it perfectly beamy.',\n",
       " 'His face, in\\nthe confusion I was in, I could not well distinguish the lineamints of,\\nany farther than that there was a great deal of youth and freshness in\\nit.',\n",
       " 'The frolic and various play of all his fine polished limbs, as they\\nappeared above the surface, in the course of his swimming or wantoning\\nwith the water, amused and insensibly delighted me; sometimes he lay\\nmotionless, on his back, waterborne, and dragging after him a fine head\\nof hair, that, floating, swept the stream in a bush of black curls.',\n",
       " 'Then the overflowing water would make a separation between his breast\\nand glossy white belly; at the bottom of which I could not escape\\nobserving so remarkable a distinction, as a black mossy tuft, out of\\nwhich appeared to emerge a round, softish, limber, white something,\\nthat played every way, with ever the least motion or whirling eddy.',\n",
       " 'I\\ncannot say but that part chiefly, by a kind of natural instinct,\\nattracted, detained, captivated my attention: it was out of the power\\nof all my modesty to command my eye away from it; and seeing nothing so\\nvery dreadful in its appearance, I insensibly looked away all my fears:\\nbut as fast as they gave way, new desires and strange wishes took\\nplace, and I melted as I gazed.',\n",
       " 'The fire of nature, that had so long\\nlain dormant or concealed, began to break out, and made me feel my sex\\nfor the first time.',\n",
       " 'He had now changed his posture, and swam prone on\\nhis belly, striking out with his legs and arms; finer modeled than\\nwhich could not have been cast, whilst his floating locks played over a\\nneck and shoulders whose whiteness they delightfully set off.',\n",
       " 'Then the\\nluxuriant swell of flesh that rose from the small of his back, and\\nterminates its double cope at where the thighs are set off, perfectly\\ndazzled one with its watery glistening gloss.',\n",
       " '“By this time I was so affected by this inward involution of\\nsentiments, so softened by this sight, that now, betrayed into a sudden\\ntransition from extreme fears to extreme desires, I found these last so\\nstrong upon me, the heat of the weather too perhaps conspiring to exalt\\ntheir rage, that nature almost fainted under them.',\n",
       " 'Not that I so much\\nas knew precisely what was wanting to me: my only thought was, that so\\nsweet a creature, as this youth seemed to me, could only make me happy;\\nbut then, the little likelihood there was of compassing an acquaintance\\nwith him, or perhaps of ever seeing him again, dashed my desires, and\\nturned them into torments.',\n",
       " 'I was still gazing, with all the powers of\\nmy sight, on this bewitching object, when, in an instant, down he went.',\n",
       " 'I had heard of such things as a cramp seizing on even the best\\nswimmers, and occasioning their being drowned; and imagining this so\\nsudden eclipse to be owing to it, the inconceivable fondness this\\nunknown lad had given birth to, distracted me with the most killing\\nterrors; insomuch, that my concern giving the wings, I flew to the\\ndoor, opened it, ran down to the canal, guided thither by the madness\\nof my fears for him, and the intense desire of being an instrument to\\nsave him, though I was ignorant how, or by what means to effect it: but\\nwas it for fears, and a passion so sudden as mine, to reason!',\n",
       " 'All this\\ntook up scarce the space of a few moments.',\n",
       " 'I had then just life enough\\nto reach the green borders of the waterpiece, where wildly looking\\nround for the young man, and missing him still, my fright and concern\\nsunk me down in a deep swoon, which must have lasted me some time; for\\nI did not come to myself, till I was roused out of it by a sense of\\npain that pierced me to the vitals, and awaked me to the the most\\nsurprising circumstance of finding myself not only in the arms of this\\nvery young gentleman I had been so solicitous to save; but taken at\\nsuch an advantage in my unresisting condition, that he had actually\\ncompleted his entrance into me so far, that weakened as I was by all\\nthe preceding conflicts of mind I had suffered, and struck dumb by the\\nviolence of my surprise, I had neither the power to cry out, nor the\\nstrength to disengage myself from his strenuous embraces, before,\\nurging his point, he had forced his way and completely triumphed over\\nmy virginity, as he might now as well see by the streams of blood that\\nfollowed his drawing out, as he had felt by the difficulties he had met\\nwith consummating his penetration.',\n",
       " 'But the sight of the blood, and the\\nsense of my condition, had (as he told me afterwards), since the\\nungovernable rage of his passion was somewhat appeased, now wrought so\\nfar on him, that at all risks, even of the worst consequences, he could\\nnot find in his heart to leave me, and make off, which he might easily\\nhave done.',\n",
       " 'I still lay all discomposed in bleeding ruin, palpitating,\\nspeechless, unable to get off, and frightened, and fluttering like a\\npoor wounded partridge, and ready to faint away again at the sense of\\nwhat had befallen me.',\n",
       " 'The young gentleman was by me, kneeling, kissing\\nmy hand, and with tears in his eyes, beseeching me to forgive him, and\\noffering all the reparation in his power.',\n",
       " 'It is certain that could I,\\nat the instant of regaining my senses, have called out, or taken the\\nbloodiest revenge, I would not be stuck at it; the violation was\\nattended too with such aggravating circumstances, though he was\\nignorant of them, since it was to my concern for the preservation of\\nhis life, that I owed my ruin.',\n",
       " '“But how quick is the shift of passions from one extreme to another!',\n",
       " 'and how little are they acquainted with the human heart who dispute it!',\n",
       " 'I could not see this amiable criminal, so suddenly the first object of\\nmy love, and as suddenly of my just hate, on his knees, bedewing my\\nhands with his tears, without relenting.',\n",
       " 'He was still stark-naked, but\\nmy modesty had been already too much wounded, in essentials, to be so\\nmuch shocked as I should have otherwise been with appearances only; in\\nshort, my anger ebbed so fast, and the tide of love returned so strong\\nupon me, that I felt it a point of my own happiness to forgive him.',\n",
       " 'The\\nreproaches I made him were murmured in so soft a tone, my eyes met his\\nwith such glances, expressing more languor than resentment, that he\\ncould not but presume his forgiveness was at no desperate distance; but\\nstill he would not quit his posture of submission, till I had\\npronounced his pardon in form; which after the most fervent entreaties,\\nprotestations, and promises, I had not the power to withhold.',\n",
       " 'On which,\\nwith the utmost marks of a fear of again offending, he ventured to kiss\\nmy lips, which I neither declined nor resented: but on my mild\\nexpostulation with him upon the barbarity of his treatment, he\\nexplained the mystery of my ruin, if not entirely to the clearance, at\\nleast much to the alleviation of his guilt, in the eyes of a judge so\\npartial in his favour as I was grown.',\n",
       " '“It seems that the circumstance of his going down, or sinking, which in\\nmy extreme ignorance I had mistaken for something very fatal, was no\\nother than a trick of diving, which I had not ever heard, or at least\\nattended o, the mention of: and he was so long-breathed at it, that in\\nthe few moments in which I ran out to save him, he had not yet emerged,\\nbefore I fell into the swoon, in which, as he rose, seeing me extended\\non the bank, his first idea was, that some young woman was upon some\\ndesign of frolic or diversion with him, for he knew I could not have\\nfallen asleep there without his having seen me before: agreebly to\\nwhich notion he had ventured to approach, and finding me without sign\\nof life, and still perplexed as he was what to think of the adventure,\\nhe took me in his arms at all hazards, and carried me into the\\nsummer-house, of which he observed the door open: there he laid me down\\non the couch, and tried, as he protested in good faith, by several\\nmeans to bring me to myself again, till fired, as he said, beyond all\\nbearing by the sight and touch of several parts of me, which were\\nunguardedly exposed to him, he could no longer govern his passion; and\\nthe less, as he was not quite sure that his first idea of this swoon\\nbeing a feint, was not the very truth of the case; seduced then by this\\nflattering notion, and overcome by the present, as he styled them,\\nsuper-human temptations, combined with the solitude and seeming\\nsecurity of the attempt, he was not enough his own master not to make\\nit.',\n",
       " 'Leaving me then just only whilst he fastened the door, he returned\\nwith redoubled eagerness to his prey: when, finding me still entranced,\\nhe ventured to place me as he pleased, whilst I felt, no more than the\\ndead, what he was about, till the pain he put me to roused me just in\\ntime enough to be witness of a triumph I was not able to defeat, and\\nnow scarce regretted: for as he talked, the tone of his voice sounded,\\nmethought, so sweetly in my ears, the sensible nearness of so new and\\ninteresting an object to me, wrought so powerfully upon me, that, in\\nthe rising perception of things in a new and pleasing light, I lost all\\nsense of the past injury.',\n",
       " 'The young gentleman soon discerned the\\nsymptoms of a reconciliation in my softened looks, and hastening to\\nreceive the seal of it from my lips, pressed them tenderly to pass his\\npardon in the return of a kiss so melting fiery, that the impression of\\nit being carried to my heart, and thence to my new discovered sphere of\\nVenus, I was melted into a softness that could refuse him nothing.',\n",
       " 'When\\nnow he managed his caresses and endearments so artfully, as to\\ninsinuate the most soothing consolations for the past pain and the most\\npleasing expectations of future pleasure, but whilst mere modesty kept\\nmy eyes from seeing his and rather declined them, I had a glimpse of\\nthat instrument of mischief which was now, obviously even to me, who\\nhad scarce had snatches of a comparative observation of it, resuming\\nits capacity to renew it, and grew greatly alarming with its increase\\nof size, as he bore it no doubt designedly, hard and stiff against one\\nof my hands carelessly dropt; but then he employed such tender\\nprefacing, such winning progressions, that my returning passion of\\ndesire being now so strongly prompted by the engaging circumstances of\\nthe sight and incendiary touch of his naked glowing beauties, I yield\\nat length at the force of the present impressions, and he obtained of\\nmy tacit blushing consent all the gratifications of pleasure left in\\nthe power of my poor person to bestow, after he had cropt its richest\\nflower, during my suspension of life, and abilities to guard it.',\n",

       " 'As I\\ngrew up, under the eyes of my mother, who kept on the business, I could\\nnot but see, in her severe watchfulness, the marks of a slip, which she\\ndid not care should be hereditary; but we no more choose our passions\\nthan our features or complexions, and the bent of mine was so strong to\\nthe forbidden pleasure, that it got the better, at length, of all her\\ncare and precaution.',\n",
       " 'I was scarce twelve years old, before that part\\nwhich she wanted so much to keep out of harm’s way, made me feel its\\nimpatience to be taken notice of, and come into play; already had it\\nput forth the signs of forwardness in the sprout of a soft down over\\nit, which had often fluttered, and I might also say, grown under my\\nconstant touch and visitation, so pleased was I with what I took to be\\na kind of title to womanhood, that state I pined to be entered of, for\\nthe pleasures I conceived were annexed to it; and now the growing\\nimportance of that part to me, and the new sensations in it, demolished\\nat once all my girlish play-things and amusements.',\n",
       " 'Nature now pointed\\nme strongly to more solid diversions, while all the stings of desire\\nsettled so fiercely in that little centre of them, that I could not\\nmistake the spot I wanted a playfellow in.',\n",

       " 'And now his waistcoat was unbuttoned, and the confinement of the\\nbreeches burst through, when out started to view the amazing, pleasing\\nobject of all my wishes, all my dreams, all my love, the king member\\nindeed!',\n",
       " 'I gazed at, I devoured it, at length and breadth, with my eyes\\nintently directed to it, till his; getting upon me, and placing between\\nmy thighs, took from me the enjoyment of its sight, to give me a far\\nmore grateful one, in its touch, in that part where its touch is so\\nexquisitely affecting.',\n",
       " 'Applying it then to the minute opening, for such\\nat that age it certainly was, I met with too much good will, I felt\\nwith too great a rapture of pleasure the first insertion of it, to heed\\nmuch the pain that followed: I thought nothing too dear to pay for this\\nthe richest treat of the sense; so that, split up, torn, bleeding,\\nmangled I was still superiorly pleased, and hugged the author of all\\nthis delicious ruin.',\n",
       " 'But when, soon after, he made his second attack,\\nsore as every thing was, the smart was soon put away by the sovereign\\ncordial; all my soft complainings were silenced, and the pain melting\\nfast away into pleasure.',\n",

       " 'He saluted me with great gallantry, and handed me into the\\ndrawing room, the floor of which was overspread with a Turkey carpet,\\nand all its furniture voluptuously adapted to every demand of the most\\nstudied luxury; now too it was, by means of a profuse illumination,\\nenlivened by a light scarce inferior, and perhaps more favourable to\\njoy, more tenderly pleasing, than that of broad sunshine.',\n",
       " 'On my entrance into the room, I had the satisfaction!',\n",
       " 'to hear a buzz of\\napprobation run through the whole company, which now consisted of four\\ngentlemen, including my particular (this was the cant term of the house\\nfor one’s gallant for the time), the three young-women, in a neat\\nflowing dishabille, the mistress of the academy, and myself.',\n",

       " 'They assured me that I was so perfectly to their taste, as to have but\\none fault against me, which I might easily be cured of, and that was my\\nmodesty: this, they observed, might pass for a beauty the more with\\nthose who wanted it for a heightener; but their maxim was, that it was\\nan impertinent mixture, and dashed the cup so as to spoil the sincere\\ndraught of pleasure; they considered it accordingly as their mortal\\nenemy, and gave it no quarter wherever they met with it.',\n",
       " 'This was a\\nprologue not unworthy of the revels that ensued.',\n",
       " 'In the midst of all the frolic and wantonness, which this joyous band\\nhad presently, and all naturally, run into, an elegant supper was\\nserved in, and we sat down to it, my spark elect placing himself next\\nto me, and the other couples without order or ceremony.',\n",
       " 'The delicate\\ncheer and good wine soon banished all reserve; the conversation grew as\\nlively as could be wished, without taking too loose a turn: these\\nprofessors of pleasure knew too well, how to stale impressions of it,\\nor evaporate the imagination of words, before the time of action.',\n",
       " 'Kisses however were snatched at times, or where a handkerchief round\\nthe neck interposed its feeble barrier, it was not extremely respected:\\nthe hands of the men went to work with their usual petulance, till the\\nprovocation on both sides rose to such a pitch, that my particulars’s\\nproposal for beginning the country dances was received with instant\\nassent: for, as he laughingly added, he fancied the instruments were in\\ntune.',\n",
       " 'This was a signal for preparation, that the complaisant Mrs.\\nCole, who understood life, took for her cue of disappearing; no longer\\nso fit for personal service herself, and content with having settled\\nthe order of battle, she left us the field, to fight it out at\\ndiscretion.',\n",
       " 'As soon as she was gone, the table was removed from the middle, and\\nbecame a side-board; a couch was brought into its place, of which when\\nI whisperingly inquired the reason, of my particular, he told me, “that\\nas it was chiefly on my account that his convention was met, the\\nparties intended at once to humour their taste of variety in pleasures,\\nand by an open public enjoyment, to see me broke of any taint of\\nreserve or modesty, which they looked on as the poison of joy; that\\nthough they occasionally preached pleasure, and lived up to the text,\\nthey did not enthusiastically set up for missionaries, and only\\nindulged themselves in the delights of a practical instruction of all\\nthe pretty women they liked well enough to bestow it upon, and who fell\\nproperly in the way of it; but that as such a proposal might be too\\nviolent, too shocking for a young beginner, the old standers were to\\nset an example, which he hoped I would not be averse to follow, since\\nit was to him I was devolved in favour of the first experiment; but\\nthat still I was perfectly at my liberty to refuse the party, which\\nbeing in its nature one of pleasure, supposed an exclusion of all force\\nor constraint.”\\n\\nMy countenance expressed, no doubt, my surprise as my silence did my\\nacquiescence.',\n",

       " 'Her gallant was now ready,\\nhaving disencumbered himself from his clothes, overloaded with lace,\\nand presently, his shirt removed, shewed us his forces at high plight,\\nbandied and ready for action.',\n",
       " 'But giving us no time to consider the\\ndimensions, he threw himself instantly over his charming antagonist who\\nreceived him as he pushed at once dead at mark, like a heroine, without\\nflinching; for surely never was girl constitutionally truer to the\\ntaste of joy, or sincerer in the expressions of its sensations, than\\nshe was: we could observe pleasure lighten in her eyes, as he\\nintroduced his plenipotentiary instrument into her; till, at length,\\nhaving indulged her to its utmost reach, its irritations grew so\\nviolent, and gave her the spurs so furiously, that collected within\\nherself, and lost to every thing but the enjoyment of her favourite\\nfeelings, she retarded his thrusts with a just concert of spring\\nheaves, keeping time so exactly with the most pathetic sighs, that one\\nmight have numbered the strokes in agitation by their distinct murmurs,\\nwhilst her active limbs kept wreathing and intertwisting with his, in\\nconvulsive folds: then the turtle-billing kisses, and the poignant\\npainless lovebites, which they both exchanged, in a rage of delight,\\nall conspiring towards the melting period.',\n",

       " 'ah!',\n",
       " 'ah!...” All her accents now faultering into heart-fetched sighs, she\\nclosed her eyes in the sweet death, in the instant of which we could\\neasily see the signs in the quiet, dying, languid posture of her late\\nso furious driver, who was stopped of a sudden, breathing short,\\npanting, and, for that time, giving up the spirit of pleasure.',\n",
       " 'As soon\\nas he was dismounted, Louisa sprung up, shook her petticoats, and\\nrunning up to me, gave me a kiss, and drew me to the side-board, to\\nwhich she was herself handed by her gallant, where they made me pledge\\nthem in a glass of wine, and toast a droll health of Louisa’s proposal\\nin high frolic.',\n",
       " 'By this time the second couple was ready to enter the lists: which were\\na young baronet, and that delicatest of charmers, the winning, tender\\nHarriet.',\n",
       " 'My gentle esquire came to acquaint me with it, and brought me\\nback to the scene of action.',\n",
       " 'And, surely, never did one of her profession accompany her\\ndispositions, for the barefaced part she was engaged to play, with such\\na peculiar grace of sweetness, modesty and yielding coyness, as she\\ndid.',\n",
       " 'All her air and motions breathed only unreserved, unlimited\\ncomplaisance without the least mixture of impudence, or prostitution.',\n",
       " 'But what was yet more surprising, her spark elect, in the midst of the\\ndissolution of a public open enjoyment, doated on her to distraction,\\nand had, by dint of love and sentiments, touched her heart, though for\\na while the restraint of their engagement to the house laid him under a\\nkind of necessity of complying with an institution which himself had\\nhad the greatest share establishing.',\n",
       " 'Harriet was then led to the vacant couch by her gallant, blushing as\\nshe looked at me, and with eyes made to justify any thing, tenderly\\nbespeaking of me the most favourable construction of the step she was\\nthus irresistibly drawn into.',\n",
       " 'Her lover, for such he was, sat her down at the foot of the couch, and\\npassing his arm round her neck, preluded with a kiss fervently applied\\nto her lips, that visibly gave her life and spirit to go through with\\nthe scene; and as he kissed, he gently inclined her head, till it fell\\nback on a pillow disposed to receive it, and leaning himself down all\\nthe way with her, at once countenanced and endeared her fall to her.',\n",
       " 'There, as if he had guessed our wishes, or meant to gratify at once his\\npleasure and his pride, in being the master, by the title of present\\npossession, of beauties delicate beyond imagination, he discovered her\\nbreast to his own touch, and our common view; but oh!',\n",

       " 'Her legs still kept the ground; and now, with the tenderest attention\\nnot to shock or alarm her too suddenly, he, by degrees, rather stole\\nthan rolled up her petticoats; at which, as if a signal had been given,\\nLouisa and Emily took hold of her legs, in pure wantonness, and, in\\nease to her, kept them stretched wide abroad.',\n",
       " 'Then lay exposed, or, to\\nspeak more properly, displayed the greatest parade in nature of female\\ncharms.',\n",

       " 'Her thighs were so\\nexquisitely fashioned, that either more in, or more out of flesh than\\nthey were, they would have declined from that point of perfection they\\npresented.',\n",
       " 'But what infinitely enriched and adorned them, was the sweet\\nintersection formed, where they met, at the bottom of the smoothest,\\nroundest, whitest belly, by that central furrow which nature had sunk\\nthere, between the soft relievo of two pouting ridges, and which, in\\nthis girl, was in perfect symmetry of delicacy and miniature with the\\nrest of her frame.',\n",

       " 'nothing in nature could be of a beautifuller\\ncut; then, the dark umbrage of the downy spring moss that over-arched\\nit, bestowed, on the luxury of the landscape, a touching warmth, a\\ntender finishing, beyond the expression of words, or even the paint of\\nthought.',\n",
       " 'Her truly enamoured gallant, who had stood absorbed and engrossed by\\nthe pleasure of the sight long enough to afford us time to feast ours\\n(no fear of glutting!)',\n",

       " 'Standing then between Harriet’s legs, which were supported by\\nher two companions at their widest extension, with one hand he gently\\ndisclosed the lips of that luscious mouth of nature, whilst with the\\nother, he stooped his mighty machine to its lure, from the height of\\nhis stiff stand-up towards his belly; the lips, kept open by his\\nfingers, received its broad shelving head of coral hue: and when he had\\nnestled it in, he hovered there a little, and the girls then delivered\\nover to his hips the agreeable office of supporting her thighs; and\\nnow, as if he meant to spin out his pleasure, and give it the more play\\nfor its life, he passed up his instrument so slow that we lost sight of\\nit inch by inch, till at length it was wholly taken into the soft\\nlaboratory of love, and the mossy mounts of each fairly met together.',\n",
       " 'In the mean time, we could plainly mark the prodigious effect the\\nprogressions of this delightful energy wrought in this delicious girl,\\ngradually heightening her beauty as they heightened her pleasure.',\n",
       " 'Her\\ncountenance and whole frame grew more animated; the faint blush of her\\ncheeks, gaining ground on the white, deepened into a florid vivid\\nvermillion glow, her naturally brilliant eyes now sparkled with\\nten-fold lustre; her languor was vanished, and she appeared quick,\\nspirited and alive all over.',\n",
       " 'He had now fixed, nailed, this tender\\ncreature, with his home-driven wedge, so that she lay passive by force,\\nand unable to stir, till beginning to play a strain of arms against\\nthis vein of delicacy, as he urged the to-and-fro con-friction, he\\nawakened, roused, and touched her so to the heart, that unable to\\ncontain herself, she could not but reply to his motions, as briskly as\\nher nicety of frame would admit of, till the raging stings of the\\npleasure rising towards the point, made her wild with the intolerable\\nsensations of it, and she now threw her legs and arms about at random,\\nas she lay lost in the sweet transport; which on his side declared\\nitself by quicker, eager thrusts, convulsive gasps, burning sighs,\\nswift laborious breathing, eyes darting humid fires: all faithful\\ntokens of the imminent approaches of the last gasp of joy.',\n",
       " 'It came on\\nat length: the baronet led the extasy, which she critically joined in,\\nas she felt the melting symptoms from him, in the nick of which, gluing\\nmore ardently than ever his lips to hers, he shewed all the signs of\\nthat agony of bliss being strong upon him, in which he gave her the\\nfinishing titillation; inly thrilled with which, we saw plainly that\\nshe answered it down with all effusion of spirit and matter she was\\nmistress of, whilst a general soft shudder ran through all her limbs,\\nwhich she gave a stretch out, and lay motionless, breathless, dying\\nwith dear delight; and in the height of its expression, showing,\\nthrough the nearly closed lids of her eyes, just the edges of their\\nblack, the rest being rolled strongly upwards in their extasy; then her\\nsweet mouth appeared languishingly open, with the tip of her tongue\\nleaning negligently towards the lower range of her white teeth, whilst\\nnatural ruby colour of her lips glowed with heightened life.',\n",
       " 'Was not\\nthis a subject to dwell upon?',\n",
       " 'And accordingly her lover still kept on\\nher, with an abiding delectation, till compressed, squeezed and\\ndistilled to the last drop, he took leave with one fervent kiss,\\nexpressing satisfied desires, but unextinguished love.',\n",
       " 'As soon as he was off, I ran to her, and sitting down on the couch by\\nher, rais’d her head, which she declined gently, and hung on my bosom,\\nto hide her blushes and confusion at what had passed, till by degrees\\nshe re-composed herself, and accepted of a restorative glass of wine\\nfrom my spark, who had left me to fetch it to her, whilst her own was\\nreadjusting his affaire and buttoning up; after which he led her,\\nleaning languishingly upon him, to oar stand of view round the couch.',\n",
       " 'And now Emily’s partner had taken her out for her share in the dance,\\nwhen this transcendently fair and sweet tempered creature readily stood\\nup; and if a complexion to put the rose and lily out of countenance,\\nextreme pretty features, and that florid health and bloom for which the\\ncountry girls are so lovely, might pass her for a beauty, this she\\ncertainly was, and one of the most striking of the fair ones.',\n",
       " 'Her gallant began first, as she stood, to disengage, her breasts, and\\nrestore them to the liberty of nature, from the easy confinement of no\\nmore than a pair of jumps; but on their coming out to view, we thought\\na new light was added to the room, so superiourly shining was their\\nwhiteness; then they rose in so happy a swell as to compose her a well\\nhorned fullness of bosom, that had such an effect on the eye as to seem\\nflash hardened into marble, of which it emulated the polished gloss,\\nand far surpassed even the whitest, in the life and lustre of its\\ncolours, white weined with blue.',\n",
       " 'Who could refrain from such provoking\\nenticements in reach?',\n",
       " 'he touched her breasts, first lightly, when the\\nglossy smoothness of the skin eluded his hand, and made it slip along\\nthe surface; he pressed them, and the springy flesh that filled them,\\nthus pitted by force, rose again reboundingly with his hand, and on the\\ninstant defaced the pressure: and alike indeed was the consistence of\\nall those parts of her body throughout, where the fulness of flesh\\ncompacts and constitutes all that fine firmness which the touch is so\\nhighly attached to.',\n",
       " 'When he had thus largely pleased himself with this\\nbranch of dalliance and delight, he trussed up her petticoat and shift,\\nin a wisp to her waist, where being tucked in, she stood fairly naked\\non every side; a blush at this overspread her lovely face, and her eyes\\ndowncast to the ground, seemed to be for quarter, when she had so great\\na right to triumph in all the treasures of youth and beauty that she\\nnow so victoriously displayed.',\n",
       " 'Her legs were perfectly well shaped and\\nher thighs, which she kept pretty close, shewed so white, so round, so\\nsubstantial and abounding in firm flesh, that nothing could afford a\\nstronger recommendation to the luxury of the touch, which he\\naccordingly did not fail to indulge in.',\n",
       " 'Then gently removing her hand,\\nwhich in the first emotion of natural modesty, she had carried thither,\\nhe gave us rather a glimpse than a view of that soft narrow chink\\nrunning its little length downwards, and hiding the remains of it\\nbetween her thighs; but plain was to be seen the fringe of light-brown\\ncurls, in beauteous growth over it, that with their silk gloss created\\na pleasing variety from the surrounding white, whose lustre too, their\\ngentle embrowning shade, considerably raised.',\n",
       " 'Her spark then\\nendeavoured, as she stood, by disclosing her thighs, to gain us a\\ncompleter sight of that central charm of attraction, but not obtaining\\nit so conveniently in that attitude, he led her to the foot of the\\ncouch, and bringing it to one of the pillows gently inclined her head\\ndown, so that as she leaned with it over her crossed hands, straddling\\nwith her thighs wide spread, and jutting her body out, she presented a\\nfull back view of her person, naked to her waist.',\n",
       " 'Her posteriors,\\nplump, smooth, and prominent, formed luxuriant tracts of animated snow,\\nthat splendidly filled the eye, till it was commanded down the parting\\nor separation of those exquisitely white cliffs, by their narrow vale,\\nand was there stopt, and attracted by the embowered bottom-savity, that\\nterminated this delightful vista and stood moderately gaping from the\\ninfluence of her bended posture, so that the agreeable interior red of\\nthe sides of the orifice came into view, and with respect to the white\\nthat dazzled round it, gave somewhat the idea of a pink slash in the\\nglossiest white satin.',\n",
       " 'Her gallant, who was a gentleman about thirty,\\nsomewhat inclined to a fatness that was in no sort displeasing,\\nimproving the hint thus tendered him of this mode of enjoyment, after\\nsetting her well in this posture, and encouraging her with kisses and\\ncaresses to stand him thro’, drew out his affair ready erected, and\\nwhose extreme length, rather disproportioned to its breadth, was the\\nmore surprising, as that excess is not often the case with those of his\\ncorpulent habit; making then the right and direct application, he drove\\nit up to the guard, whilst the round bulge of those Turkish beauties of\\nher’s, tallying with the hollow made with the bent of his belly and\\nthighs, as he curved inwards, brought all those parts, surely not\\nun-delightfully, into warm touch, and close conjunction; his hands he\\nkept passing round her body, and employed in toying with her enchanting\\nbreasts.',\n",
       " 'As soon too as she felt him at home as he could reach, she\\nlifted her head a little from the pillow, and turning her neck, without\\nmuch straining, but her cheeks glowing with the deepest scarlet, and a\\nsmile of the tenderest satisfaction, met the kiss he pressed forward to\\ngive her as they were thus close joined together: when leaving him to\\npursue his delights, she hid again her face and blushes with her hands\\nand pillow, and thus stood passively and as favourably too as she\\ncould, whilst he kept laying at her with repeated thrusts and making\\nthe meeting flesh on both sides resound again with the violence of\\nthem; then ever as he backened from her, we could see between them part\\nof his long white staff foamingly in motion, till, as he went on again\\nand closed with her, the interposing hillocks took it out of sight.',\n",
       " 'Sometimes he took his hands from the semi-globes of her bosom, and\\ntransferred the pressure of them to those large ones, the present\\nsubjects of his soft blockade, which he squeezed, grasped and played\\nwith, till at length in pursuit of driving, so hotly urged, brought on\\nthe height of the fit, with such overpowering pleasure, that his fair\\npartner became now necessary to support him, panting, fainting and\\ndying as he discharged; which she no sooner felt the killing sweetness\\nof, than unable to keep her legs, and yielding to the mighty\\nintoxication, she reeld, and falling forward on the couch, made it a\\nnecessity for him, if he would preserve the warm-pleasure hold, to fall\\nupon her, where they perfected, in a continued conjunction of body and\\necstatic flow, their scheme of joys for that time.',\n",
       " 'As soon as he had disengaged, the charming Emily got up, and we crowded\\nround her with congratulations and other officious little services; for\\nit is to be noted, that though all modesty and reserve were banished\\nfrom the transaction of these pleasures, good manners and politeness\\nwere inviolably observed: there was no gross ribaldry, no offensive or\\nrude behaviour, or ungenerous reproaches to the girls for their\\ncompliance with the humours and desires of the men.',\n",
       " 'On the contrary,\\nnothing was wanting to soothe, encourage, and soften the sense of their\\ncondition to them.',\n",
       " 'Men know not in general how much they destroy of\\ntheir own pleasure, when they break through the respect and tenderness\\ndue to our sex, and even to those of it who live only by pleasing them.',\n",
       " 'And this was a maxim perfectly well understood by these polite\\nvoluptuaries, these profound adepts in the great art and science of\\npleasure, who never shewed these votaries of theirs a more tender\\nrespect than at the time of those exercises of their complaisance, when\\nthey unlocked their treasures of concealed beauty, and shewed out in\\nthe pride of their native charms, ever more touching surely than when\\nthey parade it in the artificial ones of dress and ornament.',\n",
       " 'The frolic was now come round to me, and it being my turn of\\nsubscription to the will and pleasure of my particular elect, as well\\nas to that of the company, he came to me, and saluting me very\\ntenderly, with a flattering eagerness, put me in mind of the\\ncompliances my presence there authorized the hopes of, and at the same\\ntime repeated to me, “that if all this force of example had not\\nsurmounted any repugnance I might have to concur with the humours and\\ndesires of the company, that though the play was bespoke for my\\nbenefit, and great as his own private disappointment might be, he would\\nsuffer any thing, sooner than be the instrument of imposing a\\ndisagreeable task.”\\n\\nTo this I answered, without the least hesitation, or mincing grimace,\\n“that had I not even contracted a kind of engagement to be at his\\ndisposal without the least reserve, the example of such agreeable\\ncompanions would alone determine me, and that I was in no pain about\\nany thing but my appearing to so great a disadvantage after such\\nsuperior beauties.” And take notice that I thought, as I spoke.',\n",
